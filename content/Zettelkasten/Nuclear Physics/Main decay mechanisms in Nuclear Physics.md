We begin our analysis of decay mechanisms by referring to the [[The nuclide chart|nuclide chart]], specifically to their position respect to the stability line.
Up to $^{208}\mbox{Pb}$, so $N<126$, there are mainly 2 reasons why a nuclide decays towards the stability line: proton or neutron excess.
### **Proton excess**
Suppose a nuclide has a proton excess and want to stabilize its energy. This can happen, for example due to an high Coulomb repulsion between protons.
==We list now the possibilities in order of likelihood according to the proton excess:

- $\beta^-$ decay
A proton is converted in a neutron, an electron ($\beta^-$) and an anti electronic neutrino:

$$ p \to n + \beta^- + \bar{\nu}_e $$
- $\alpha$ decay
### **Neutron excess**
Suppose a nuclide has a neutron excess and want to stabilize its energy.
There are mainly two methods.
 -  $\beta^+$ decay
