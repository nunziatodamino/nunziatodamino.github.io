We say that the vector operator $\bar{J} =(J_x,J_y,J_z)$ is an angular momentum operator if its component satisfies the following commutation relationship:

$$ [J_x,J_y]=i\hbar J_z\qquad[J_z,J_x]=i\hbar J_y\qquad[J_y,J_z]=i\hbar J_x $$

Note that these type of relationships are cyclic relations.
Is also easy to see that, defined $J^2 \equiv J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2$, one can prove:

$$ [J^2, J_i]=0 \qquad i=x,y,z $$

#### Common eigenstates of $J^2$ and $J_z$

The relation $[J^2, J_i]=0$ implies that the 2 operators has a common set of eigenstates. If we choose z as our axis of quantization, i.e. we choose $i=z$ , we can write:

$$ J^2\ket{j,j_{z}}=\hbar^2 j(j+1)\ket{j,j_{z}} \qquad Jz\ket{j,j_{z}}=\hbar j_z\ket{j,j_{z}} $$

So that $\ket{j,j_{z}}$ is the common eigenstate characterized by the quantum numbers $j$ and $j_z$, while:

$$ \braket{J^2} = \hbar^2 j(j+1) \qquad  \braket{J_z} = \hbar j_z $$

One can prove (cfr. Nardulli) that:

$$ j = \mbox{whole number or half-whole} \qquad j_z=-j, -j+1, \dots0, \dots j-1, j  $$

Where the multiplicity of $j_z$ is $2j+1$.
Note that the particular form of $J$ puts restriction on the set of solution for $j$.
