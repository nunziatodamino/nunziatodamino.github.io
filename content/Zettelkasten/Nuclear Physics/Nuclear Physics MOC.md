The reason for this difference between fissile and fissionable materials
is the so-called odd-even effect for nuclei. It has been observed that nuclei with even numbers
of neutrons and/or protons are more stable than those with odd numbers. Therefore, adding a
neutron to change a nucleus with an odd number of neutrons to a nucleus with an even number
of neutrons produces an appreciably higher binding energy than adding a neutron to a nucleus
already possessing an even number of neutrons.
