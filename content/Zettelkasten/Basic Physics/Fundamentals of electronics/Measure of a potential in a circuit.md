Suppose we have the symbol for a generator 
![[Pasted image 20230311145758.png|50]]
- One way to interpret the information is to think that the generator $v$ gives a positive potential $V$. 
- The other, more meaningful is to imagine 2 probes, one in B and one in A, and to imagine a line that goes from B to A. If I encounter a generator $v$, from $-$ to $+$ I gain a potential $V$.
