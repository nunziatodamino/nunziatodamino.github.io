Let's consider a current flowing in a conductor. Then if this conductor is immersed in a magnetic field each charge carrier will experience a Lorentz force. 
Yet we observe a force on the whole conductor, of electric nature.
Let's consider the situation in figure. 

![[Hall effect.png|300]]

(a) We start with a conducting slab in which a current $\bar{J}=\sigma \bar{E}=\rho \bar{v}$ is established. The electron will then move in the opposite direction of the electric field.
(b) We then turn on a magnetic field $\bar{B}$ perpendicular to the slab. Then the electrons will experience a Lorentz force that forces them on the bottom of the plate, leading to a charge separation and thus to the formation of an electric field inside the material.
(c) The Lorentz force remains constant, while the electric field due to the charge separation grows until it matches the Lorentz force (steady state).
**Notice that in this situation the electrons are in equilibrium, while the reticular ions experience a force due to the separation field.**

This phenomenon is called **Hall effect** and the separation field established is usually called Hall field.

Now we try to evaluate quantitatively the phenomenon given that , reached the steady state, we can measure a constant voltage between the top and bottom slab extremities.

We start by consideration on the equilibrium condition between the Lorentz force and the separation force:

$$ qvB=qE_H \qquad \iff \qquad E_H=vB $$

By then multiplying and dividing by the charge density:

$$E_H=\frac{1}{\rho}JB = \frac{1}{nq}JB \equiv R_HJB$$

where $n$ is the charge carrier density per unit volume.

So we can set the following experiment: we prepare the setting for the Hall effect, measure the voltage between top and bottom extremities of the slab and evaluate $E_H = U_H \cdot h$, where $h$ is the slab height. Then we measure $J$ by measuring $I$ with an ammeter and then evaluate $J = \frac{I}{A} = \frac{I}{h d}$ where $d$ is the slab thickness.  
In the end on can measure $R_H$ by taking different experimental point varying the applying current to the conductor.

As a result, a measurement of $R_H$ , called Hall coefficient allows us to evaluate the charge carrier density of a material.

**Notice that we expect from the classical theory that $R_H>0$, but experiment shows that for some materials, say aluminium, $R_H<0$**

This can only by explain by the [[Band model]]
