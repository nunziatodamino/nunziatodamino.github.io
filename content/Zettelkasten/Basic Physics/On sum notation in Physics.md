Sometimes in a Physics textbook on can encounter sums of the type:

$$ \sum_{i\neq j} f(x_{ij})\qquad \text{or} \qquad \sum_{i< j} f(x_{ij})$$

The problem with this notation is that we do not know if the sum is performed over both indexes or just one.

This problem cannot be (sadly) avoided while reading the textbooks and must be inferred by the context. In these notes however we will indicate these type of sums using a non-ambiguous notation.

Supposing for simplicity $i,j \in A$:

- We will denote the sums over 2 indexes: 

$$ \sum_{i,j\in A |i\neq j} f(x_{ij})\qquad \text{or} \qquad \sum_{i,j \in A|i< j} f(x_{ij})$$

- We will denote the sums over 1 index: 

$$ \sum_{i\in A |i\neq j} f(x_{ij})\qquad \text{or} \qquad \sum_{i \in A|i< j} f(x_{ij})$$
