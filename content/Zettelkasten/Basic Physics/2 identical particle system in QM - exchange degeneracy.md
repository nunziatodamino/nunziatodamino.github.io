Suppose I have a particle described by a ket $\ket{\alpha} \in V_1$ and another particle with the same intrinsic properties but in a different quantum state, described by a ket $\ket{\beta} \in V_1$.
Suppose also that these kets are eigenvectors of operators in the CSCO (complete set of commuting observables), so that if I measure the system I obtain $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

The system in total can be described by $\ket{\alpha}\otimes\ket{\beta}$ or equivalently, by the tensor product commutativity, by $\ket{\beta}\otimes\ket{\alpha}$, or even more generally by a linear combination of the 2:

$$ c_1 (\ket{\alpha}\otimes\ket{\beta})+c_2 (\ket{\beta}\otimes\ket{\alpha}) \qquad |c_1|^2+|c_2|^2=1$$

**But this is problematic, because the specification of the eigenvalues should collapse the wavefunction according to our principles, and in this cause it doesn't happen.**

This problem is called **exchange degeneracy** and is solved by the [[Zettelkasten/Basic Physics/Bosons and fermions - the symmetrization postulate|Bosons and fermions - the symmetrization postulate]]
