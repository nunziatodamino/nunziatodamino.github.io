Given an EM wave with a given wave vector $\bar{k}$ that defines its propagation direction and orientation, one can define, in the scheme of linearly polarised waves:

1.  Transverse Electric (TE) Waves:
 TE waves are electromagnetic waves in which the electric field vector is perpendicular (transverse) to the direction of wave propagation, while the magnetic field vector lies in the plane of propagation.
-   In TE waves, there is no electric field component parallel to the direction of propagation, meaning the electric field lines oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.
-   These waves typically occur in waveguides or structures with well-defined boundaries, where the electric field is zero at the walls or boundaries.

2.  Transverse Magnetic (TM) Waves:
 TM waves are electromagnetic waves in which the magnetic field vector is perpendicular (transverse) to the direction of wave propagation, while the electric field vector lies in the plane of propagation.
-   In TM waves, there is no magnetic field component parallel to the direction of propagation, meaning the magnetic field lines oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.
-   Like TE waves, TM waves also occur in waveguides or structures with well-defined boundaries, where the magnetic field is zero at the walls or boundaries.
