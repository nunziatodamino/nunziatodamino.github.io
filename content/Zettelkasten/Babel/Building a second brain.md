- So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom. 

* The practice of keeping personal notes also arose in other countries, such as biji in China (roughly translated as "notebook'), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticism, short fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, zuihitsu (known as "pillow books') were collections of notebooks used to document a person's life.

• Forse il commonplace book di Leonardo erano i codici ?

- Your notes will be useless if you can't decipher them in the future, or if they're so long that you don't even try. 
(ovvero pensare al fatto, e a quanto, che le note su obsidian debbano avere una lunghezza definita)

- personal knowledge management exists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction.

- Your Second Brain shouldn’t be just another way of confirming what you already know. We are already surrounded by algorithms that feed us only what we already believe and social networks that continually reinforce what we already  think. 

- By placing a note in a project folder, you ensure you’ll see it next time you work on that project. By  placing it in an area folder, you’ll come across it next time you’re thinking about  that area of your work or life. By placing it in a resource folder, you’ll notice it only if and when you decide to dive into that topic and do some reading or research. By placing it in archives, you never need to see it again unless you want to.

- To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain  
wisdom, remove things every day.  
—Lao Tzu, ancient Chinese philosopher

- As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.

- Building a Second Brain is really about standardizing the way we work,
because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something.
To get stronger, you need to lift weights using the correct form. A musician relies
on standardized notes and time signatures so they don’t have to reinvent the
basics from scratch every time. To improve your writing, you need to follow the
conventions of spelling and grammar (even if you decide to break those rules for
special effect down the road)

- Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in
one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project using only the
notes you’ve gathered in front of you . No searching online, no browsing social
media, and no opening multiple browser tabs that you swear you’re going to get
to eventually. Only work with what you already have. This first pass could be a
plan, an agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas
into a tangible artifact.

- the only time we have available to  
maintain our systems is during the execution of our regular work.  
There’s no time that’s magically going to become available for you to stop  
everything and completely reorganize your digital world.

The three habits most important to your Second Brain include:
Project Checklists: Ensure you start and finish your projects in a consistent
way, making use of past work.
Weekly and Monthly Reviews: Periodically review your work and life and
decide if you want to change anything.
Noticing Habits: Notice small opportunities to edit, highlight, or move
notes to make them more discoverable for your future self.
