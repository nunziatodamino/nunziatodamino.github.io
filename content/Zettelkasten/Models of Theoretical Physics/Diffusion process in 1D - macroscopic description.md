The macroscopic approach is obtained by the [[Construction of the continuity equation]] , then we want to have an expression for the current density vector by using the [[Fick's law]], and in the end we put all together.
We obtain:

>[!info] **The diffusion equation**
>$$ \frac{\partial \rho_n(\bar{r},t)}{\partial t}-\bar{\nabla}\cdot \left( D(\bar{r}) \bar{\nabla}\rho_n(\bar{r},t) \right)  = 0$$
