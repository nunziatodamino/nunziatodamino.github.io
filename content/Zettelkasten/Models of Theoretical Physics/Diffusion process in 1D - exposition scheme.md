We will follow this exposition scheme in exploring the diffusion phenomenon:

![[Diffusion equation - reasoning scheme.png|500]]

This seems overkill, but in each implication we will gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon:

- Setting of the discrete master equation: [[Diffusion process in 1D - microscopic description]]
- Setting of the Diffusion equation : [[Diffusion process in 1D - macroscopic description]]
- Solution of the discrete master equation: [[Diffusion process in 1D - solution of the discrete master equation]]
- Solution of the Diffusion equation : [[Diffusion process in 1D - PDE resolution]]
- Continuum limit from the discrete master equation to the diffusion equation: [[Diffusion process in 1D - link between microscopic and macroscopic equations]]
- Continuum limit from the solution of the discrete master equation to the solution of the diffusion equation: [[Diffusion process in 1D - link between microscopic and macroscopic solutions]]

Then some very interesting properties can be derived from the consideration above:

- In the continuum limit the diffusion equation solution is a Gaussian for the Central limit theorem: [[Diffusion process in 1D - a particular case of Central limit theorem]]
- Solution of the diffusion equation by means of a propagator: [[Diffusion process in 1D - Propagator form of the diffusion equation solution]]
