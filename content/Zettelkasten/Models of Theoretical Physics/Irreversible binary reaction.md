Suppose to have the elementary irreversibile binary reaction:

$$ \alpha X+\beta Y \to \gamma Z + \delta T $$

Then we can assign as rate equation of this reaction, the following:

$$ r = k_+[X]^{\alpha}[Y]^{\beta} $$

Where $k_+$ is the reaction coefficient of the reaction going forward.

Note that in general the powers of the concentrations are the stoichiometric coefficients only for an elementary reaction.

We now write the ODE system that describes the concentrations dynamics. By indicating $[X]\equiv x$, i.e. the concentrations with the relative lower case letters, we will have:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = -\alpha  k_+x^{\alpha}y^{\beta}   \\
\dot{y} = -\beta  k_+x^{\alpha}y^{\beta}  \\
\dot{z} = \gamma  k_+x^{\alpha}y^{\beta}   \\
\dot{t} = \delta  k_+x^{\alpha}y^{\beta} 
\end{cases}
$$

Generally these kind of systems are solved numerically.
