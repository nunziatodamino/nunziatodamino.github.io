Suppose to have an elementary reaction process of the type:

$$ \alpha A+\beta B \leftrightarrows \gamma C + \delta D $$

Where the greek letters are stoichiometric coefficients indicating the moles of the relative species in capital letters.
We state the following:

>[!info] **The law of mass action**
>Given the elementary reaction $\alpha A+\beta B \leftrightarrows \gamma C + \delta D$, the relative concentration will evolve over time until they will reach a constant value.
>Hence is possible to define:
>
>$$K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^{\gamma}[D]^{\delta}}{[A]^{\alpha}[B]^{\beta}}$$ 
>
>Which is called equilibrium constant of the reaction.
