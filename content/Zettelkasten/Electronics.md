**Currents in Perspective**

Understanding the magnitude of electrical currents is essential when working with electronic devices. It provides a basis for comparison. Here are some examples:

- A 100-W lightbulb draws about 1 A.
- A microwave draws 8 to 13 A.
- A laptop computer typically consumes 2 to 3 A.
- An electric fan operates at approximately 1 A.
- A television requires 1 to 3 A.
- A toaster utilizes 7 to 10 A.
- A fluorescent light uses 1 to 2 A.
- A radio or stereo system draws 1 to 4 A.
- A typical LED consumes only 20 mA.
- When a mobile (smart) phone accesses the web, it uses around 200 mA.
- An advanced low-power microchip can range from a few A to possibly even several pA.
- An automobile starter demands around 200 A.
- A lightning strike generates approximately 1000 A.
- A sufficient amount of current to induce cardiac or respiratory arrest ranges from 100 mA to 1 A.
