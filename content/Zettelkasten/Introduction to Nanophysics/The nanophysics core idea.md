All Nanophysics arises from a simple concept, which is the size control.
From Solid State Physics we are accustomed to specific properties of materials, derived from the fundamental hypothesis that one can neglected the surface effects because of the extended size.
When the size is such that [[When the surface becomes important|one has to consider the surface effects]], all the Nanophysics arises.
In one simple sentence, ==Nanophysics is Solid State with surface effects not neglected==.

First, in order to control the size, we must be able to describe the [[Synthesis methods]], in which one of the most important process to consider is the [[Nucleation theory|nucleation]].

Once the size is controlled, we can see it in action in general, in the concept of [[Size equations]], and specifically for the melting temperature in the [[Zettelkasten/Introduction to Nanophysics/Thermodynamic size effect (TSE)|Thermodynamic size effect (TSE)]], or we can explore more complex examples, like the [[L-SPR (Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance)]].
