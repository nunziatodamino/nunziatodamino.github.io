## Polarization on nanospheres

Suppose we a system of interacting NP's. It's important the direction of the polarization to which our system is subjected.
Here, we assume that the particles of size a are arranged within ordered one- or two-dimensional arrays with interparticle spacing d. We further assume that $a << d$, so that the dipolar approximation is justified, and the particles can be treated as point dipoles.
Furthermore two regimes have to be distinguished, depending on the magnitude of the interparticle distance respect to the incoming wave wavelength.

- For closely spaced particles, $d << λ$, near-field interactions with a distance dependence of $d^{−3}$ dominate, and the particle array can be described as an array of point dipoles interacting via their near-field, as shown in the picture.

In this regime 2 more cases has to distinguished, the one with transverse polarization (first case), where the k vector is impinging either from the left or the right, and the longitudinal polarization (second case) where the k vector is impinging either from the top or the bottom.

Let's evaluate if the energy is different from the single particle case, and in which direction the shift happens. 
- In the transverse polarization case the near field is approximatively the oscillating dipole field. Each particle tends to widen the electric cloud displacement of each dipole, and the effect is uniform on the chain if consider an impinging plane wave. this widened dipole field is bigger than the spherical one, and tend to restore faster the oscillation of the nearby particles, so that the electrons oscillate faster (like a seesaw motion)
- in the parallel polarization case the near field is again the oscillating dipole field, this time the the particles oscillates in such a way that the opposing charge cloud cancels out, and is like we have an elliptic electronic cloud, to which we now, from Gans theory, a redshift and so a lower energy configuration.

We report our consideration here in this recap image:
