>Given a generic statistical distribution saying that one wants to evaluate is average value doesn't mean anything.

Is necessary (but rarely done) to specify what kind of average one is evaluating. 

We define the following:

Given a set of numbers we call:

- mean-average, or simply mean: the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of numbers
- median-average, or simply median: the middle value in the number list if this is ordered from smallest to largest
- mode-average, or simply mode: is the most frequently occurring value on the list

Why this is not an error mentioned in literature ? Because in the $90\%$ percent of cases we are going to evaluate averages on the [[Gaussian probability distribution]], in which all these concepts coincides.
