In the integral evaluation and in some proof is useful the following result:

>[!info] **Darboux's lemma**
>Let  $f:A\subseteq\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function in A, and let $\gamma$ be a contour entirely contained in $A$.
>Then:
>$$\left| \int_{\gamma}f(z)dz \right| \leq \sup_{z\in\gamma}|f(z)| |\gamma| \equiv M L $$
