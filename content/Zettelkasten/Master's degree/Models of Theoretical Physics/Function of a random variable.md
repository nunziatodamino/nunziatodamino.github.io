We state in the following a fundamental proposition in order to work with continuous random variables:

>[!info] **Change of variables in 1 dimension**
>Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with PDF $f_{X}(x)$, and let $Y=g(X)$ be a new random variable , where g is differentiable in its domain and monotonous.
>Then the PDF of $Y$ is given by:
>
>$$ f_{Y}(y)= \left| \frac{dx}{dy} \right| f_{X}(x) $$
