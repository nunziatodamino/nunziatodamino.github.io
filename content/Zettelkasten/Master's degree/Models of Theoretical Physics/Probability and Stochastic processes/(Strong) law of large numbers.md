>[!important] **Theorem - (Strong) law of large numbers**
>- **Hp.** Let be $n$ i.i.d random variables whose pdf is $\rho(x)$ and with c.f. $\varphi_1(k)$, with mean $\mu = \int dx_i\  x_i \rho(x_i);\ \forall i$ .
> Let also $x$ be the random variable constructed as : $x = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n x_i$ (called empirical average).
> - **Th.** The random variable $x$ converges to $\mu$ as $n \to +\infty$

As stated in [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Models of Theoretical Physics/Probability and Stochastic processes/(Weak) law of large numbers|(Weak) law of large numbers]] ==there exists cases in which the pdf's converges while the random variables don't==, so is necessary to prove the theorem in this way.
