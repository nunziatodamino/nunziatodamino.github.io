>[!info] **Independent identical distributed random variables (i.i.d.)**
>Suppose we have 2 random variable $x_1$ and $x_2$ each of which has its pdf $p(x_1)$ and $q(x_2)$ respectively. Suppose now to consider their joint probability density function $p(x_1,x_2)$.
>- We will say that the random variables are **identical** if :
>
>$$ q(x_2)=p(x_1) $$
>- We will say that the random variables are **independent** if :
>
>$$ p(x_1,x_2)= p(x_1)q(x_2) $$
>
>Moreover we will say that are **independent identical distributed (i.i.d.)** if both conditions are satisfied:
>
>$$ p(x_1,x_2)= p(x_1)p(x_2) $$
