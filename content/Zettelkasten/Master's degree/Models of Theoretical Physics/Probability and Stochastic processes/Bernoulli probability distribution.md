Suppose we want to model the following phenomenon: we have a random variable that can assume 2 values, $X=1$ with probability $p$ and $X=0$ with probability $q=1-p$.

So that the probability mass function is:

$$ p_X(x)=
\begin{cases}
p\ \ \ \quad\qquad\mbox{if}\ x=1 \\
1-p\qquad\mbox{if}\ x=0 \\
\end{cases} $$
