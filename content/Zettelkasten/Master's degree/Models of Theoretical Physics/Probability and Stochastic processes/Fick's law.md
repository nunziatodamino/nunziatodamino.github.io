Suppose we have a particle system of volume $S$ where there are no interactions, i.e. no e.m field  no gravity, etc.  Is it possible to observe a non zero current density on the boundary of a volume $V \subseteq S$ ?
Generally yes, if we have a gradient in the particle density. 

==Note that this law is of experimental character.
We observe that particles tend to move from more dense zones to less dense zone.==

This phenomenon is described by the fundamental:

>[!info] **Fick's law**
>  $$ \bar{j}(\bar{r}, t) = - D(\bar{r},t) \bar{\nabla}\rho_n(\bar{r},t)$$

Where $D(\bar{r},t)$ is called diffusion coefficient, and can be a function even if generally we consider it constant.
