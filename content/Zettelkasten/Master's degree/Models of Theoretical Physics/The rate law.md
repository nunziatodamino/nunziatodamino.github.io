Suppose to have an elementary chemical reaction process. We state the following law:

>[!info] **The rate law**
> In first approximation the reaction rate of any chemical reaction process  is proportional to the product of the reactants concentrations :
> 
> $$r(a,b) = k [A][B] =  k\ ab$$

Where we used $[A]\equiv a$ as a shorthand for the molar concentration.

Note that this rate law is usually improperly referred to as the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Models of Theoretical Physics/Law of mass action]].

Moreover more imprecision has to come: because in general the rate equation is an experimental equation and is given a priori, is usually stated as rate law the generic assignment of a rate equation for a specific process.
