>[!note] Kolmogorov's axioms of Probability
>- Axiom 1: For any event $A$, $P(A) \geq 0$.
>- Axiom 2: Probability of the sample space $S$ is $P(S)=1$
>- Axiom 3: If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \cdots$ are countable disjoint events, then :$P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3\cdots)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+\cdots$

Whenever I have a integral over the sample space and I don't know where to integrate one has to check for the particular distribution the support set. i.e. for a normal distribution:

So our integrals will be over $\mathbb{R}$.
