We state here what we mean by identical and distinguishable particles in Quantum Mechanics in contrast with Classical Mechanics.

Suppose to have 2 or more particles.
By **identical** we mean that they have the same intrinsic properties, say mass, charge, spin etc. ,while by **distinguishable** we mean that they are we can label them at any time instant, i.e. they have a trajectory.

**So is clear that, due to Heisenberg's exclusion principle, that identical particles in QM must be indistinguishable.** 

This has profound consequences.
