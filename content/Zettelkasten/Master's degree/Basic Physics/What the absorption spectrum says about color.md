In order to obtain information on color from an absorption spectrum, one must have a spectrum in the visible range, any other range of wavelength can't give this information.
Then we consider the color associated to the peaks, according to the electromagnetic spectrum:

Then we sum (if needed) them according to the color theory, and ==the color of the object will be the complimentary of the summed color obtained by the peaks==
