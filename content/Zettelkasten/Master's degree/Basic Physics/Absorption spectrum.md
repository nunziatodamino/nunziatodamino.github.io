An absorption spectrum is a fundamental concept in spectroscopy, representing ==how a substance interacts with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, across different wavelengths or frequencies==. It consists of the following:

 - We [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Basic Physics/How to select a definite wavelength from a light source|select the wavelength]] range of the incident light a priori. This determines the type of spectroscopy (UV-VIS, IR, etc.). This incident light is directed through a sample.

- As the light passes through the sample, the particles within it, which can be atoms, molecules, or ions, absorb specific wavelengths of light due to their energy level configurations. This absorption occurs at particular, well-defined wavelengths.

- ==A detector placed on the other side of the sample measures the intensity of light that emerges from it==. The detector records how much light is transmitted at each wavelength.

- The collected data is graphically represented on an absorption spectrum. On the graph, the x-axis represents the range of wavelengths or frequencies, and the y-axis represents the so called absorbance, evaluate from the intensity of the transmitted light. (see [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Introduction to Nanophysics/Approfondimenti/Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law]]) ==Peaks on the spectrum indicate wavelengths where the substance absorbs light most strongly, while troughs represent regions of minimal absorption==.

These absorption patterns reveal information about the sample's electronic, vibrational, or rotational energy levels. Different substances exhibit unique absorption spectra.
