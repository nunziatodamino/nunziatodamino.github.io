To remember the order of electron orbitals, recall the following diagram:

Quickly remember that the number preceding the orbital is the principal quantum number, denoted as "n." The letters "s, p, d, f" respectively indicate the quantum numbers for orbital angular momentum, where "l" corresponds to 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Each orbital can accommodate a number of electrons equal to 2(2l+1). The "2" in front represents spin degeneracy.
