The nuclide chart, also called Segr√® chart is a representation of all possible nuclides, arranged respect to the number of neutron $N$ along the x-axis and the number of protons $Z$ along the y-axis.
Moreover in this chart, given a nuclide, is indicated the principal type of decay mechanism, making this chart one of the most useful tool to inspect nuclides stability.
