We set the following experiment, we study the $\sigma_{ext}$ for different materials (in a real experimental setting we will obtain rather the absorbance, which is proportional) all embedded in silica, and all with size $R=\pu{5 nm}$.
We obtain the following:

In each peak is highlighted the wavelength in which we have the Frolich condition.

==We decide if a material is a good plasmonic one if the plasmonic resonance peak is sharper respect to the rest of the spectra.==

This strictly depends on the overlap of the interband transition region in wavelength and the wavelength in which we have the Frolich condition. Let's analyze each case.

First we recall (Ashcroft-Mermin pg.295) that is possible to evaluate the interband threshold with the following:

$$ \hbar \omega = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = 0.64 E_F $$

- Ag (Silver) : ($E_F = \pu{5.49 eV}$) The interband transition threshold is $\lambda \simeq \pu{353 nm}$ , while $\lambda_{SPR} \simeq \pu{405 nm}$.
Moreover $\Im(\varepsilon)$ is small, and this guarantees a sharp peak.

- Au (Gold) : ($E_F = \pu{5.53 eV}$) The interband transition threshold is $\lambda \simeq \pu{350nm}$ , while $\lambda_{SPR} \simeq \pu{530 nm}$.

- Cu (Copper) : ($E_F = \pu{7.00 eV}$) The interband transition threshold is $\lambda \simeq \pu{277nm}$ , while $\lambda_{SPR} \simeq \pu{570 nm}$.
