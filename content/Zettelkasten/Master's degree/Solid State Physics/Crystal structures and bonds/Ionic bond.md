This bond is typically formed between two atoms with significantly different electronegativities.

One atom, typically a metal, loses electrons to become a positively charged ion (cation), while the other atom, often a non-metal, gains those electrons to become a negatively charged ion (anion). The resulting electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond, holding them together in a stable compound. Ionic compounds, like table salt (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCl), are examples of substances held together by ionic bonds.

**Property of the ionic bond**

- They are considered to be among the strongest of all types of chemical bonds. This often causes ionic compounds to be very stable.
- Ionic bonds have high bond energy. Bond energy is the mean amount of energy required to break the bond in the gaseous state.
- Most ionic compounds exist in the form of a crystal structure, in which the ions occupy the corners of the crystal
- Ionic compounds lose their crystal lattice structure and break up into ions when dissolved in water or any other polar solvent. This process is called solvation. The presence of these free ions makes aqueous ionic compound solutions good conductors of electricity. The same occurs when the compounds are heated above their melting point.
