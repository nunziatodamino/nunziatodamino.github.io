##### Notable examples: Diamond

An important example of a Bravais lattice with a basis is the diamond structure, which is obtained from the FCC and the addition of two base vectors:

The base vectors are: $$ \bar{b}_1=\bar{0} \qquad \bar{b}_2= \frac{a}{4} (\hat i +\hat j + \hat k) $$
##### Notable examples: HCP (Hexagonal closed packed)

The example of HCP is obtained from a hexagonal Bravais lattice with the addition of 2 base vectors
