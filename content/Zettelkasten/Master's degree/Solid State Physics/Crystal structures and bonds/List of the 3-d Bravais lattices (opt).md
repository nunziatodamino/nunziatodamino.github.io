In 3 dimensions there are 14 possible Bravais lattices:

In order to remember them is better to categorize them further on these macro categories, called primitive crystal systems

#### Cubic System

1. **Simple Cubic (SC)**
    - Atoms at the corners of a cube.
2. **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)**
    - Atoms at the corners and a single atom at the center of the cube.
3. **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)**
    - Atoms at the corners and at the centers of each face of the cube.

#### Tetragonal System

4. **Simple Tetragonal**
    - Atoms at the corners of a rectangular prism with square bases.
5. **Body-Centered Tetragonal**
    - Atoms at the corners and a single atom at the center of the rectangular prism with square bases.

#### Orthorhombic System

6. **Simple Orthorhombic**
    - Atoms at the corners of a rectangular prism with all sides of different lengths.
7. **Base-Centered Orthorhombic**
    - Atoms at the corners and at the centers of two opposite faces.
8. **Body-Centered Orthorhombic**
    - Atoms at the corners and a single atom at the center of the prism.
9. **Face-Centered Orthorhombic**
    - Atoms at the corners and at the centers of all faces of the prism.

#### Monoclinic System

10. **Simple Monoclinic**
    - Atoms at the corners of a rectangular prism with a parallelogram base.
11. **Base-Centered Monoclinic**
    - Atoms at the corners and at the centers of two opposite faces parallel to the parallelogram base.

#### Triclinic System

12. **Simple Triclinic**
    - Atoms at the corners of a prism with no perpendicular edges or equal lengths.

#### Hexagonal System

13. **Simple Hexagonal**
    - Atoms at the corners of a hexagonal prism with a hexagonal base.

#### Rhombohedral (Trigonal) System

14. **Simple Rhombohedral**
    - Atoms at the corners of a rhombohedron (a distorted cube where all faces are rhombuses).


Note that, except few variations, all lattices systems are different flavors of the orthorombic.
In fact the monoclinic system is the orthorombic when the base lenghts are equals and the cubic system is the orthorombic when all sides are equal.


Especially important in applications are the one belonging to the cubic system.
Some additional considerations are made about these in this [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Particular evaluations for the Bravais lattice structures of the cubic system - atoms per unit cell and nearest neighbors calculation|remark]].
