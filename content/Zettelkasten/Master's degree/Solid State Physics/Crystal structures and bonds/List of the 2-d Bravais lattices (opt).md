What was said before previously holds at the level of definitions, with the particular attention that the primitive vectors must be 2. As a result, the unit cell has a surface equal to the magnitude of the cross product of the primitive vectors, i.e. $V_u = |\bar{a}_1 \times \bar{a}_2|$ .
Furthermore, there are a total of 5 Bravais lattices in 2 dimensions:

Note that the hexagonal is often called triangular.
