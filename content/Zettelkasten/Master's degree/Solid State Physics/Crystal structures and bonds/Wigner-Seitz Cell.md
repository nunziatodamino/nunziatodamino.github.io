It is convenient, for the purposes of applications, to establish the primitive cell  of a [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Bravais lattice|Bravais lattice]] in a different way. Specifically, we want to choose a primitive cell that completely contains an atom at its center. The Wigner-Seitz cell is defined as a region of space that contains all points with a distance less than the minimum, given an atom.

One way to geometrically construct such a cell is as follows:

-   select an atom
-   identify the nearest neighbors
-   connect these atoms to the central atom through a linear combination of the primitive vectors
-   consider the midpoint of the segment connecting the atom and its nearest neighbor and consider a plane passing through that point and having as a director vector the vector connecting the central atom to the nearest neighbor. The cell obtained from the closed and limited intersection of such planes is called the Wigner-Seitz cell. 

This primitive unit cell is rarely utilised in the crystal description, but is indeed essential in the description of the reciprocal space.
