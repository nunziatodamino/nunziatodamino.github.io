The Lennard-Jones potential is a semi-empirical potential that describes the interaction between neutral atoms or molecules. It takes into account the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] at short distances and the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Van der Waals bond|Van der Waals bond]] at long distances (respect the atomic radius) . The potential is given by:

$$U(R) = 4 \varepsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{R}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{R}\right)^{6}\right]$$

Here, $\varepsilon$ and $\sigma$ are experimental parameters. The plot below illustrates the potential:

This is just one way of modeling the interaction between neutral atoms.
One can also have a system where is the Pauli exclusion principle contribution which is of interest (i.e. densely packed system). In that case is useful to use other potentials, such as the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Born-Mayer potential]]
