Having found the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Total energy in an ionic bond and Madelung constant|total energy]] of our ionic crystal, we can minimize it with respect to $R$, in order to find the equilibrium distance $R_0$.
We obtain:

$$ \frac{dU_{tot}}{dR} = 0  \iff -\frac{z\lambda}{\rho}e^{-\frac{R_0}{\rho}} + \alpha \frac{k_eq^2}{R_0^2} =0 \iff R_0^2e^{-\frac{R_0}{\rho}} = \frac{k_e\rho q^2\alpha}{z\lambda}$$

The last equation can be solved analytically for $R_0$.

Corresponding to this distance, we can evaluate the corresponding energy $U_{tot}(R_{0})$, that is called cohesive energy.
