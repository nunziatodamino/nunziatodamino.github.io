### Section 0 - Fundamental constants

### Section 1 - Typical Debye temperatures for solids

Table presente has units in Kelvin:

So we have in general $\Theta_D \sim 200-400\ \text{K}$. We recall that for a solid, if $T \sim \Theta_D$ the electronic contribution in the heat capacity evaluation can be discarded.
