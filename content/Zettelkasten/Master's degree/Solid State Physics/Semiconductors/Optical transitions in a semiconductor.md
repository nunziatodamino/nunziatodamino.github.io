Given a semiconductor 2 possible band gaps are possible: direct band gaps, where the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band are at the same $k$ value and indirect band gaps, where these values are at different $k$ values.

The case of direct band gap is trivial. One must supply a photon of $\hbar\omega_g = E_g$ in order to have a transition.

In the case of indirect band gap instead the stationary point are shifted by a phonon of wavevector $\bar{q}$ to which one can associate the frequency $\omega(\bar{q})$.
Then the transition happens at the phonon energy $\hbar\omega_t + \hbar\omega(\bar{q}) = \hbar\omega_g  \iff \hbar\omega_t = \hbar\omega_g - \hbar\omega(\bar{q})$ if the phonon is absorbed by the electron $(+q$ in the chosen direction) or happens at the phonon energy $\hbar\omega_t - \hbar\omega(\bar{q}) = \hbar\omega_g  \iff \hbar\omega_t = \hbar\omega_g + \hbar\omega(\bar{q})$ if the phonon is emitted by the electron $(-q$ in the chosen direction)

Let's analyze the optical transition of the 2 cases in function of an incoming photon energy, by studying the absorption (I think that with absorption is implied we mean absorbance evaluated with [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Introduction to Nanophysics/Approfondimenti/Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law|Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law]]) at $T=0\ \text{K}$ :

(Note that we are analyzing a situation in which a phonon is emitted, not absorbed, in contrast with the previous image).
