We define intrinsic semiconductor a natural occurring solid (non-doped) which is an insulator and has an energy band gap of the order of $\sim 1 \ \text{eV}$ at $T=0\ \text{K}$.

Note that an intrinsic conductor can be still conductive at $T=0\ \text{K}$ if:
- If subjected to a DC voltage, the voltage is so high to cause a breakdown voltage inside the material.
- If subjected to a AC voltage, the frequency $\omega$ is so high that $\hbar \omega >E_g$
