One can increase the charge carriers concentrations by orders of magnitude of an [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Semiconductors/Intrinsic or homogeneous semiconductor|Intrinsic or homogeneous semiconductor]] by introducing defects in particular positions of the atomic structure of the homogeneous semiconductor.

This procedure is called **doping**.
There are mainly 2 types of doping: 
- **Donor doping** : we will call impurities that contribute to the carrier density of a semiconductor are called donors if they supply additional electrons to the conduction band
- **Acceptor doping** : we will call acceptors instead impurities that supply additional holes to (i.e., capture electrons from) the valence band. 

Donor impurities are atoms that have a higher chemical valence than the atoms making up the pure (host) material, while acceptors have a lower chemical valence.
