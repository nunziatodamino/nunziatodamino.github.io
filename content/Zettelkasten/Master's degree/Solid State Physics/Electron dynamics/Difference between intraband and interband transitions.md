These terms are generally used when describing transition in the electrons dynamics in a solid.
We know that in this context there are particular dispersion relations for a solid, and defined values for the wavevector $\bar{k}$. If we have a transition, i.e. the wavevector changes, 2 things can happen: the new energy value lies in the same dispersion curve (band) and we call this **intraband transition**, or the new energy value lies on a different dispersion curve (band) and we call this **interband transition**.

In general for models like the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Free electron model for metals (Sommerfeld model)|Free electron model for metals (Sommerfeld model)]] (where is only one dispersion curve) or the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Band theory|Band theory]] (where interband transition are forbidden) we are considering only intraband transition, so much so that is sometimes omitted.
