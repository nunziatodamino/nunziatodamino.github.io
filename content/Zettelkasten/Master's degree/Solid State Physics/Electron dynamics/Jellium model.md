This model is a crude approximation based on the assumption of the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Free electron model for metals (Sommerfeld model)|Free electron model for metals (Sommerfeld model)]], used to describe electron-electron interaction.

Supposing that a metal is described by the free electron model, its ground state its characterized by a uniform charge distribution $\rho_0$ (or equivalently a uniform number density $n_0$ , such that $\rho_0=-en_0$)  due to the non interacting electron gas.
In order to achieve neutrality, we can think to superimpose this distribution to an opposite positive charge distribution, instead of considering the point-like distribution of the ions.

Suppose then we excite the system, say with an external electric field. Then the electronic charge distribution will be deformed in a space dependent fashion $\rho(\bar{r})=-e n(\bar{r})$ .
Then the distribution will oscillate around the fixed positive one till the ground state is reached again.
The image is like the one of a perturbed jelly, hence the model name.
