Most properties of solids can be derived in the context of [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Lattice dynamics/The harmonic approximation|The harmonic approximation]].
Some others leads to extreme incongruousness if this is carried on.

One notable example is the thermal conductivity in solids: if an harmonic approximation is made, due to the fact that in this framework the phonons are non interacting, they cannot lose energy in a periodic structure, leading to an infinite thermal conductivity.
Even if defects are introduced the thermal conductivity that arises has a wrong temperature dependance from the experimental one.

The only solution is not to truncate the potential energy at the second order, but truncate to the necessary term (not truncating at all, while ideal, leads to extremely difficult calculations)
Each term above the second order is called anharmonic term.
