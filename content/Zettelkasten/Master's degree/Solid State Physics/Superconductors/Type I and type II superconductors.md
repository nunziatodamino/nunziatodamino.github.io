As seen in the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Superconductors/Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect|Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect]], a weak magnetic field is expelled from a superconductor when this is in the superconductor state $T<T_c$.
However the application of strong magnetic field can destroy the superconducting state, i.e. even when the condition $T<T_c$ is met the magnetic field lines are not expelled from the inside of the material.

The modality of conversion to the normal state depends both on the intrinsic properties of the specimen and also on the geometry of the sample.
In order to put in evidence genuine microscopic properties of the sample, we consider exclusively the structure of long, thin, cylindrical rods with axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. **This geometry assures that the field inside a normal specimen is spatially uniform and equal to the external applied field**. In this “standard geometry”, demagnetization factors are zero, and end effects are ignored. 

The behavior of superconductors in magnetic fields divides them into two classes; correspondingly they are called type-I (or soft) superconductors and type-II (or hard) superconductors

First we recall, from what we seen in the Meissner effect, that if we are in the superconducting state $\bar{B} = -4 \pi \bar{H}$.
### Soft (type I) superconductors

At a given temperature $T$ and in uniform external magnetic field $\bar{H}$,  there is a critical value for the external magnetic field, such as, for $H>H_c(T)$, the superconducting state is destroyed.
We can represent this in the following phase diagram (note $\rho$ is the resistivity of the material):

The equilibrium curve $H_c(T )$ divides the H−T plane in the “normal” region and in the “superconducting” (or “Meissner”) region, as schematically shown. 
In a number of superconducting materials of type-I we have:

$$ H_c(T ) = H_c(0 )\left( 1-\frac{T^2}{T_c^2} \right)$$

In literature is more common to show this phase change using a graph plotting $M$ versus $H$, considering that in the Meissner state $\bar{H} = -4 \pi \bar{M}$. So we have , for type I superconductors:

![[Immagini/Type I and type II superconductors_typeI_2.png|400]]

For $H > H_c(T )$ we have a normal metal given that for the present considerations the magnetic susceptibility of the normal metal can be safely disregarded (for a normal metal $\chi \sim −10^{-6}$ and hence $-4 \pi \bar{M} = -4 \pi\chi\bar{H} \sim 0$)  .

**Most of the elemental superconducting metals are type-I superconductors**

### Hard (type II) superconductors

At a given temperature $T$ and in uniform external magnetic field $\bar{H}$,  there are now 2 critical values for the external magnetic field.
For $H<H_{c1}(T)$ the superconducting state is preserved, lines are expelled from the material ; for $H_{c1}(T)<H<H_{c2}(T)$  the flux partially penetrates the sample and subdivides into flux-bearing regions, arranged into a regular triangular lattice (Abrikosov lattice); each tube of flux is called filament or vortex, and the sample is said to be in a mixed state or vortex state or Shubnikov phase; finally for $H > H_{c2}(T )$ the superconductor state is destroyed.
Again we represent the situation using a phase diagram first :

![[Immagini/Type I and type II superconductors_type_2.png|400]]

Notice that the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T )$ may be as high as several tens of Tesla; thus the mixed state can sustain high currents in high magnetic fields, still in a practically friction-free situation (provided appropriate material inhomogeneities, called “pinning centers”, are present to hamper the motion of the flux tubes); for this reason type-II superconductors are of major interest for superconducting high field magnets and other technological applications. 
Also for the fields $H_{c1}(T )$ and $H_{c2}(T )$ we have equilibrium curves of the form as the one shown in the type I superconductors.
We show now the plot of $M$ versus $H$:
