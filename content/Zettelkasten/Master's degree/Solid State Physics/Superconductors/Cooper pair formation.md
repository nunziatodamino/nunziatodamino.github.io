**In the superconducting phase a Cooper pair (i.e. a bounded state formed by a weakly attracted pair of electrons) can be formed by a phonon-mediated interaction** in the following way. 
Consider an electron traveling in a crystal. As this passes it attract with the Coulomb interaction the ions of the lattice, leaving a deformation trail. This trail relaxes more slowly if the temperature is lower, so we consider a low temperature $(T<T_c)$.
This lattice deformation causes a weak attraction between electrons (the lattice deformation creates a zone of net positive charge which acts as an attraction center for the electron that created the trail and a second electron. In fact one can argue that any $n$ electrons can be attracted by this center, but the pair attraction is the most probable due to the attraction weakness).

This effect is very small because of the tiny distortion of the lattice and it is rather complicated to be described quantitatively. 
Moreover, this interaction is non-local in space and also retarded in time because of its origin. 

It's still possible though to estimate the size of this bound state in the following way: the second electron will feel this deformation only for a limited interval of time because after the passage of the first electron the lattice will return to its equilibrium structure. The typical time $T$ required for this relaxation to occur is of the order of the time-scale for lattice dynamics, i.e. $T âˆ¼ 2\pi/\omega_D$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency. 
Given that we have a maximum deformation at a length $l \sim v_FT=2\pi v_F/\omega_D$ behind the first electron.
Using typical parameters ($v_F \sim 10^8\ \text{m/s}$ and $\omega_D \sim 10^{13}\ \text{hz}$) **we obtain $l \sim 1000\ \mathring{\text{A}}$. which is the considered the typical estimate for the size of a Cooper pair.**
