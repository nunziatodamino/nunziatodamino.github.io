In solids, for temperatures equal to or lower than the ambient temperature, it holds for the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Thermal transport/Heat capacity]] that:

$$C_p \simeq C_v$$

The reason is given by the relationship:

$$C_p-C_v = \frac{VT\alpha^2}{\beta}$$

where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and $\beta$ is the isothermal compressibility coefficient, and it holds for solids that in this range of temperature $\alpha$ is extremely small, making the difference approximately 0.

In general, we can observe that for temperature values higher than the ambient temperature, the difference between the two specific heats increases, and specifically the one at constant pressure is higher.
