note_summary: "Thermal conductivity in solids is a non-equilibrium phenomenon for which, due to a temperature gradient, a local heat flux density is established, with direction opposite to the gradient of the temperature field. In solids 2 main mechanisms contributes to this phenomenon: thermal conduction by electrons or by phonons."

Thermal conductivity in solids is a non-equilibrium phenomenon for which, due to a temperature gradient inside the solid, a local heat flux density $\bar{Q}$ (units $[W/m^2]$) is established, with direction opposite to the gradient of the temperature field:

$$ \bar{Q} = - \kappa \bar{\nabla} T $$

The coefficient $\kappa$ is called thermal conductivity (units $[W/(m\cdot K)]$) .

The phenomenon has two main contribution, one deriving from quasi-free electrons in the solid and the other due to phonons.
The electronic contribution is larger in metals, while is negligible in insulators, where the phonon contribution is the main one.
