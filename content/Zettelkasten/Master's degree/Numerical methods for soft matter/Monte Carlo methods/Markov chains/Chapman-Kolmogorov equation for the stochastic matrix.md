We can recast the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Models of Theoretical Physics/Probability and Stochastic processes/Chapman-Kolmogorov equation|Chapman-Kolmogorov equation]] using the result in [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Numerical methods for soft matter/Monte Carlo methods/Markov chains/Probability to reach a state in n steps in a Markov's chain|Probability to reach a state in n steps in a Markov's chain]].

It's easy to show that we obtain the following:

$$ P^{l+m}=P^lP^m \quad\ l,m\geq1$$

Or in components:

$$ (P^{l+m})_{ij}=\sum_k(P^l)_{ik}(P^m)_{kj}  \quad\ l,m\geq1$$
