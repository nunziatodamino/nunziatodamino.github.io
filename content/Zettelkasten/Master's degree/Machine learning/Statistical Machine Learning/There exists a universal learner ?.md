We saw in general that our approach on learning is to balance the "size" of the hypothesis class. A winning is to use prior knowledge of the problem to restrict the available hypotheses (inductive bias), and from there proceed to learning.
A question rise spontaneously on the opposite side. There exists an universal learner, i.e. a learner that can solve a problem without any prior knowledge of the learning problem ?
The answer to this question is the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Machine learning/Statistical Machine Learning/No free lunch|No free lunch]] theorem.
