Given a radioactive nuclide this can emit radiation through different basic mechanisms, that are:

- [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/Alpha decay]]
- [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/Beta decay]]
- [[Electron capture]]
- [[Gamma emission]]
- [[Spontaneous fission]]

For each of these mechanism we observe a radiation (either a particle or a photon) with a discrete or continuous spectrum of energy.
We first report not the mechanisms, but their possible outcomes in the following table:

In the relative section we will explain why a certain mechanism leads to a certain radiation.
