The isotope $^{22}\text{Na}$ is an artificial element with an half-life $\tau= 2.603\ \text{y}$.

It has 2 decay branches:
- it can decay by electron capture with a probability of the $9.7\%$ in an excited state of the $^{22}\text{Ne}$, with further dis-excitation and emission of a $\gamma$ with energy $1274.5\ \text{keV}$ 
- it can decay by positron emission $\beta^{+}$ with a probability of the $90.2\%$ in an excited state of the $^{22}\text{Ne}$, with further dis-excitation and emission of a $\gamma$ with energy $1274.5\ \text{keV}$. Moreover we expect a $\gamma$ of $511\ \text{keV}$ from the positron emission, due to the fact that it will encounter an electron and perform electron-positron annihilation. 

Note that we expect this only because we are implicitly considering that there is no vacuum around the source, because in that case the positron will be considered stable in the vacuum region.
