#### Sensitivity to a specific radiation type
The first consideration to be made upon the general characteristic of a detector is to establish its capability to produce an usable signal given a type of radiation and given an energy range. 
This depends on several factors:
1) the cross section for ionizing reactions in the detector
2) the detector mass
3) the inherent detector noise
4) the protective material surrounding the sensitive volume of the detector.

#### Detector response
If the signal is proportional to the energy that the incident radiation loses inside the sensitive volume of the detector, and this information is conserved in the output signal, then is possible to use this proportionality to evaluate the energy of the incident radiation.
The relation between the radiation energy and the total charge (sometimes the detector functioning is based on a charging capacitor) or pulse height of the output signal is referred as the detector response.

#### Energy resolution

For detectors designed to measure the energy of the incident radiation, the most important factor is the energy resolution.
In fact we will never observe a delta-like function centered in the energy value, but a Gaussian, due to statistical fluctuations.
If we then evaluate for this Gaussian the FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum), one can define the energy resolution $R$ as:

$$ R=\frac{\text{FWHM}}{E}=\frac{2 \sqrt{2\ln2}\ \sigma_E}{E} $$

Notice that this calculation is valid only for a Gaussian. For other distribution other definition of FWHM should be used.
The resolution is usually expressed as a percentage. A lower resolution corresponds to a more precise measurement.
