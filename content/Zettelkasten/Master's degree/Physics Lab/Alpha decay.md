In the situation in which a nuclide has an excess of proton and for this reason the Coulomb repulsion is stronger than the nuclear force, the nuclide prefers to undergoes the process:

$$ X(Z,A) \to X(Z-2,A-4) + \alpha  $$

Where $\alpha$ is a $^4\text{He}$ nucleus.
Alpha decay shows a monoenergetic spectrum, generally limited between $4-6 \ \text{MeV}$.
Due to its charge, an $\alpha$ particle has a limited range in matter (typically $\sim \text{cm}$ in air), this must be taken in consideration when constructing sources.

Note that in general the alpha decay leaves the daughter nucleus in the ground state.
