Generally speaking, photons interact with matter via 3 main mechanics, according to the photon energy:

- [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/Compton's effect/The photoelectric effect]]
- [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/Compton's effect/The Compton effect]]
- [[The pair production mechanism]]

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and in some energy regions are competing, as shown in the following graph showing the cross section for each mechanism versus the energy range:
