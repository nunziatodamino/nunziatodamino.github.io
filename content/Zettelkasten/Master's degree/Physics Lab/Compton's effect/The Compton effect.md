The Compton effect encompasses the following phenomenon:

>[!info] **Compton's effect**
A photon with energy $h\nu$ can hit a free electron and recoil, changing its energy, and thus its frequency.
==Many times the electron is still bound. But if the photon energy is way higher than the binding energy the electron can be considered essentially free.==

Specifically the following relation is valid:

$$ h\nu' = \frac{h \nu}{1 + \frac{h\nu}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos \vartheta)} $$

Notice that the scattering angle is random and the probability that a scattered photon is found at the angle $\vartheta$ is given by the so called Klein-Nishina formula:

$$ \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{r^2_e}{2} \frac{1}{\left[1 + \frac{h\nu}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos \vartheta)\right]^2} \left( 1 + \cos^2 \vartheta + \frac{\left(\frac{h\nu}{m_ec^2}\right)^2(1-\cos \vartheta)^2}{1 + \frac{h\nu}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos \vartheta)} \right)$$
