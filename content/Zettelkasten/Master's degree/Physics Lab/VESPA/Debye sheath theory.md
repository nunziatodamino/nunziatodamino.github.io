When a conducting insulated object (floating or positioned on a stick of insulated material) is immersed in a plasma, it will form around it a thin sheath of positive charge density.
This sheath is called Debye sheath.

We first give an intuitive explanation on why this happens. 
In a plasma, which we recall is like a completely ionized gas, the electrons are much faster then the ions, because $m_e<<M_{ion}$. 
So when an object is immersed in a plasma is reached by a large flux of electron. If the object in question is conductive, the electrons will deposit on the surface, giving to the object a net negative charge density. This will reach a value such as will repel all the incoming electrons and begin to attract the positive ions. Then, after a while, specifically when the flux of electrons and the flux of ions are the same, a net positive charge will form on the material, because the positive charge of the ions is greater than the one of electrons.
