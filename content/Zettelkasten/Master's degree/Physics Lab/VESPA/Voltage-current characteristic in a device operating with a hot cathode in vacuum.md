We want to measure the voltage-current characteristic in a device operating with a hot cathode in vacuum, i.e. we have an electron source due to [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/VESPA/Thermoionic emission]] (hot cathode), and these electrons are accelerated through a tension $V$. Then a current density $J$ is collected and measured.
We want to establish the functional form of this current respect to the tension.

From [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/VESPA/The plane diode model]] we expect that the answer is the Child's law, but in its derivation we implicitly assumed that there is no upper bound for the thermoionic electrons, while there is, due to [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/VESPA/Thermoionic emission|Richardson's law]] (notice that the voltage parameter governing the thermoionic emission is different from the one that is responsible for the current collecting).
So in the graph we will observe that in the first part there will be a zone where the current is described by the Child's law, while after a certain voltage a saturation will be reached, due to the upper bound posed by the Richardson's law
