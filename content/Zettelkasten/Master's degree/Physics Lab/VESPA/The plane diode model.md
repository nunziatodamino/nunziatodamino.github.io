The plane diode model is used to study the behaviour of electrons when emitted in vacuum.

Specifically I want to study the effect on the charge density collected at anode. 
The idea is the following: [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/VESPA/Thermoionic emission]] can produce so much electrons that they create a cloud around the cathode, slowing the emission of the next electrons.

We have 2 situations:

- No stopping : $j=env$ (constant)

- Cloud stopping : $j = \chi \frac{V_0^{3/2}}{d^2}$ (Child's law)
