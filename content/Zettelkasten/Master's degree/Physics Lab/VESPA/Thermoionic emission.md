When a metal is heated above a certain temperature, it emits free electrons by thermoionic emission.
This happens because the thermal energy $\propto k_B T$ is greater than the necessary energy to extract an electron by ionization, i.e. $e\phi$, where $\phi$ is the extraction potential, and $e$ the electron charge.

We have an experimental law describing this phenomenon, called:

>[!info] **Richardson's law**
>A material emits a thermoionic current density $J$ according to the experimental law:
>
>$$ J = A_{exp} T^2 \exp\left( -\frac{e\phi}{k_b T} \right) $$
>
>Where $A_{exp}$ is a constant depending on the material considered

Important note ==The electron current effectively emitted from wire in vacuum can be lower than the one predicted by Richardson's law, because the emitted electrons tend to form a negatively charged cloud around the filament, which, through electrostatic repulsion, impedes the emission of further electrons, this phenomenon is explained by [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Physics Lab/VESPA/The plane diode model]]==
