There exists 2 types of $\beta$ decay:

- $\beta^-$ decay
Due to a neutron excess in the nucleus, the following process happens:

$$ n \to p + \beta^- + \bar{\nu}_e $$

I.e. A neutron is converted in a proton with the emission of an electron ($\beta^-$) and an electronic antineutrino.

- $\beta^+$ decay
Due to a proton excess in the nucleus, the following process happens:

$$ p \to n + \beta^+ + \nu_e $$

I.e. A proton is converted in a neutron with the emission of a positron ($\beta^+$) and an electronic neutrino.


Due to the fact that this is a two body decay and the neutrino (or antineutrino) mass is extremely small ($< 0.120\ \text{eV}$), we observe with common laboratory equipment just the positrons (or electrons) with a continuous spectrum of energy.
The maximum value of the spectrum (in the event in which the $\beta$ particle takes all the available energy) is equal to the Q-value of the reaction, which is in general of the order $10\ \text{keV} - \text{MeV}$. 

In most beta decays the daughter nucleus is left in an excited state, which is usually followed by a [[Gamma emission]].
Pure beta emitters exists, but are very few.
