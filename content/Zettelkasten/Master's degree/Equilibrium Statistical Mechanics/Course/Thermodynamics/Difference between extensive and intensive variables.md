We call **extensive** variables that are additive and scales with the system, i.e.
the internal energy U, the volume V, the number of particles N, the magnetisation $\bar{M}$, the total energy $E$, etc.
While we call **intensive** variables that do not scale with the system , such as the temperature $T$, the pressure $P$ or the chemical potential $\mu$.
