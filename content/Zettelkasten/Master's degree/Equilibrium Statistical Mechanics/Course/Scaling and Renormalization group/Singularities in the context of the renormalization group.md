Given that any decimation map is analytic, I cannot have never a singularity (say in the free energy or in any other quantity) in the RG method for a finite system.
The only problem is that I expect singularities to happen (say in the critical exponents for the second order phase transitions).
**So the only way in which i can have singularities in an analytical theory is in the thermodynamic limit.**
This implies that in order to decimate a system in the thermodynamic limit i must perform the RG transformation an infinite number of times.

**Apart from exotic cases, every decimation will have a fixed point in the coupling constants space.**
Formally, consider $n$ decimations that will coarse-grain the system to bigger and bigger "boxes" of linear dimension $l \to l^2\to \dots \to l^n$, leading to a set of coupling constants $[K_1]\to [K_2] \to \dots \to [K_n]$.
The sequence of coupling constants will form in $\mathbb{R}^N$ a trajectory (sometimes this space is labeled **Hamiltonian space** or **theory space**) and this trajectory will converge to a fixed point when $n\ to +\infty$.
