While Kadanoff theory provides [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Scaling and Renormalization group/Critical exponents in the context of Kadanoff argument (optional)|relations]] between critical exponents and the parameters $y_t$ and $y_h$ these are useful (without additional consideration) only in the mean field case, as in other cases there is no easy way to extract the analytical critical exponent, an thus the value of the parameter $y_t$ and $y_h$. Also the converse is true, as the theory by design give these parameters as unknowns. 
Moreover this model so not explain universality, it simply arises from the as hoc assumption.
To solve this we will need additional theory, specifically to extend this theory in the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Scaling and Renormalization group/Renormalization Group]]
