Goals of the theory:

- **Give a consistent algorithm to [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Scaling and Renormalization group/Kadanoff argument|coarse-grain]] the system.** 
This procedure, called **decimation** is the one we observed in the Kadanoff argument and is a procedure to reduce the degree of freedom. Given a system of minimal resolution $a$ and linear dimension $L$ we choose a new resolution $la$ such that:

$$ la \ll \xi  \qquad a\ll la \ll L$$

So that inside the new resolution the degree of freedom are uncorrelated by design. Then I integrate all the the degree of freedom inside this hyper-cell. **The main idea is that the coupling of the degree of freedom will change**, from say the coupling constant $K \to K'$ .

- **Identify the origin of critical behavior and explain universality**
The coarse-grain procedure will give rise to a system with correlation lenght:

$$ \xi_l = \xi/l $$

This implies that the system is farther from criticality once decimated as observed in the Kadanoff argument.
