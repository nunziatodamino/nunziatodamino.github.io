We have seen in [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Mean field approach/Variational approach in Statistical Mechanics|Variational approach in Statistical Mechanics]] that exists a equilibrium probability distribution that minimizes the free energy functional. The problem is that said distribution is generally not easily computable, so one has to resort to special approximations.

The idea is simple. If we consider the $N$ point pdf:

$$ \rho=\rho(\phi_1, \dots,\phi_N) $$

In the mean field approximation we assume that this is the product of the single one-point pdf:

$$ \rho=\rho(\phi_1, \dots,\phi_N) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}\rho^{(1)}(\phi_i)\equiv \prod_{i=1}^{N}\rho_i $$

This is equivalent to assume that particles are statistically independent (or better that the different degrees of freedom are statistically independent).
