As shown in [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Mean field approach/Van der Waals phase analysis using the isotherm plot|Van der Waals phase analysis using the isotherm plot]], there exists an universal ratio for liquid/gases that suggests a deeper connection between different fluid systems.
If we rescale the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Mean field approach/Simple mean field attraction potential in liquids - Van der Walls equation|Van der Walls equation]] respect to the critical parameters:

$$ \pi = \frac{P}{P_c}\qquad \nu=\frac{v}{v_c}\qquad \tau=\frac{T}{T_c} $$

The the VdW equation can be rewritten as :

$$ \pi =\frac{8 \tau}{3\nu-1} -\frac{3}{\nu^2}\iff\left( \pi + \frac{3}{\nu} \right)\left( 3\nu -1 \right) = 8 \tau  $$

This is usually called the law of correspondent states.
