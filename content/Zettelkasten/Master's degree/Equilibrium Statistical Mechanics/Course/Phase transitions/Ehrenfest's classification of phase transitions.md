We usually classify the phase transitions via the so called Ehrenfest's classification.
Fancy words aside we see that **a transition is an $n$-th order phase transition if one of the $n$-th order derivative respect to the control thermodynamic variables of the Gibbs free energy are discontinuous.**
This implies that we can consider only $1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ order phase transition, because higher order derivatives, while possibles, have not usually a physical meaning.
#### $1^{st}$ order phase transition
Is defined as a transition in which the first derivative of the Gibbs free energy is discontinuous.
Given that $G=G(T,P)$ we can have as first derivatives either $\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_P = -S$ or $\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial P}\right)_T = V$, so this is equivalent to the fact that the entropy or the volume is discontinuous (generally they both are).
This happens because during the transition we have an exchange of latent heat (entropy discontinuity) or a density jump (volume discontinuity).
Melting, boiling and sublimation are an example.

#### $2^{nd}$ order phase transition
Is defined as a transition in which the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy is discontinuous.
The first derivatives (entropy and volume) will be continuous, while the possible second derivative are $\left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial T^2}\right)_P = -\frac{C_P}{T}$,  $\left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P^2}\right)_T = -\frac{k_T}{T}$ and $\left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial T\partial P}\right) = -\alpha$ which are related respectively to the heat capacity, the isothermal compressibility and the thermal expansion coefficient, so the $2^{nd}$ order phase transition is equivalent to the fact that one or all of these are discontinuous. (We usually check the heat capacity and expect at $T_C$ as a discontinuity a divergence).
Paramagnetic to ferromagnetic is an example.

#### $3^{rd}$ order phase transition
Is defined as a transition in which the third derivative of the Gibbs free energy is discontinuous.
As generally there is no defined physical meaning for the third derivative, this just implies that all quantities are continuous.
Some polymer and liquid‚Äêcrystal transitions have been modeled as higher order.
