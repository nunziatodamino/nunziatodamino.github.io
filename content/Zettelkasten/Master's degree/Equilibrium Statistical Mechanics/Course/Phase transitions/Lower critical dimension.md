We define lower critical dimension the dimension under which and at which the system does not display an ordered phase, i,e, is the dimension $d_C$ such that:

$$ \text{if}\ d\leq d_c  \Rightarrow T_C = 0 $$

As we saw this is dependent, rather than the model, from the symmetry under which the model is invariant:

- Discrete global symmetries : $d_C = 1$
- Continuous global symmetries : $d_C = 2$ (also known as [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/The Ising Model/The Mermin-Wagner theorem|The Mermin-Wagner theorem]])
