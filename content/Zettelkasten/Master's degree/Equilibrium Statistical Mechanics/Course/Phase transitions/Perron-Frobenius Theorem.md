We state the following:

>[!info] **Perron-Frobenius Theorem**
>Consider a $n \times n$ real matrix, where each entry is positive, $A_{ij} >0$.
>Suppose also that each entry is a function of a $\bar{x}$.
>Then the following facts holds:
> - The matrix admits $n$ **non degenerate** eigenvalues
> - The largest eigenvalue $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+$
> - All eigenvalue are analytical function of $\bar{x}$.
> 

Why is important ? Suppose i have a model that is solvable via a transfer matrix.
**If the transfer matrix satisfies the Perron-Frobenius theorem then the model cannot exhibit a phase transition.**
