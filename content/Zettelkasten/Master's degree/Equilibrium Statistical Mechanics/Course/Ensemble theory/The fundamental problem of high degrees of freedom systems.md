Suppose to have a system of $N$ particles, where said number is high. (typical consideration are made respect to the Avogadro's number).

In the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics this system is described by $N$ generalized coordinate vectors $\bar{q}^{\ \alpha'}$, and consequently by $3N$ generalized coordinates vector components $q^{\alpha}$ and by $N$ conjugated momenta vectors $\bar{p}_{\alpha'}$, and consequently by $3N$ generalized momenta vector components $p_{\alpha}$.

The specification of both: $(q^{\ \alpha}(t_0),p_{\alpha}(t_0) )$ at some time $t_0$ implies that we now know everything about the system, due to the fact that in principle a solution of the Hamilton equations exists.
We observe that specifying these $6N$ variables is equivalent to specify a point in the phase space: $(q^{\ \alpha}(t_0),p_{\alpha}(t_0) ) \in \Gamma$ where $\Gamma \equiv \prod_{i=1}^{3N}\{q^{\alpha}(t),p_{\alpha}(t)\}$

==From now on, in our treatment of Equilibrium Statistical Physics, we will call the set containing all the generalized coordinates $q(t) \equiv \{ q^{\alpha}(t) | \alpha=1,2, \dots 3N \}$, and the set containing all the conjugated momenta 
$p(t) \equiv \{ p_{\alpha}(t) | \alpha=1,2, \dots 3N \}$.==

With this consideration we can write with a more agile notation the last observation: $(q(t_0),p(t_0) ) \in \Gamma$

==The big problem now is that the equations that ensues are generally unsolvable, neither analytically (an Hamiltonian system is generally not integrable, think to the three body problem), neither numerically (computation time exceeding timescale of the universe lifespan).==

The question is then , what can be said about the system ?
