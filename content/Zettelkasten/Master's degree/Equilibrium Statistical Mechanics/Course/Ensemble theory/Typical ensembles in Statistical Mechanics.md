There are mainly 3 types of ensembles of interest:

- [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Ensemble theory/The microcanonical ensemble|NVE ensemble]], also known as microcanonical ensemble, is an ensemble in which each system copy has number of particles $N$, volume $V$ and total energy $E$ fixed.

- [[The canonical ensemble|NVT ensemble]], also known as canonical ensemble, is an ensemble in which each system copy has number of particles $N$, volume $V$ and temperature $T$ fixed.

- [[Î¼VT ensemble]], also known as grand canonical ensemble, is an ensemble in which each system copy has chemical potential $\mu$, volume $V$ and temperature $T$ fixed.
