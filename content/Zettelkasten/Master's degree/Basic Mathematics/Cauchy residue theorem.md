This theorem is one of the most powerful tool for the evaluation of integrals

>[!info] **Cauchy residue theorem**
>Let $f:A\subseteq\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ be an holomorphic function in $A/\{z_1,z_2 \dots z_n\}$, where $z_1,z_2 \dots z_n \in \mathring{A}$
>Then the following result is valid:
>$$ \oint_{+\partial A} f(z)dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{z_j} \text{Res}(f(z);z_j) $$

How course in order to be used up one needs to able to [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Basic Mathematics/How to evaluate the residue of a function|evaluate the residue]] for the function in different situations.

Moreover is usually utilized in conjunction with [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Basic Mathematics/Lemmas for complex integration|prepackaged estimation lemmas]] , or with a more general technique linked to the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Basic Mathematics/Darboux lemma (ML inequality)]]
