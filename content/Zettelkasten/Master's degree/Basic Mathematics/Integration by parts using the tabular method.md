Suppose we are in the situation to have to integrate something of the type:

$$ \int p(x) f(x) dx $$

Where $p(x)$ is a polynomial of any order and $f(x)$ is an easily integrable function.
We can then make use of the so called tabular method:

Note : DON'T SWITCH THE COLUMNS, all the method will then be mirrored !
