### 2 particle system

The 2 particle system gives us the chance to propose an euristic derivation of the fact that, under permutation, can exists only symmetric or antisymmetric states with eigenvalues $\pm1$ respectively (cfr. Ballentine)

### 3 particle system

The 3 particle system is a very interesting example in which we see that the existence of permutation operators divide the tensor product space in different invariant subspace under permutation. 
If then we specify the type of particle of the system, i.e. bosonic, this leads to the fact that only the subspace invariant under the symmetric permutation will be non-zero.
This excess of 0 state will lead naturally to a space reformulation in which they will not be considered, the so called second quantization formalism. (cfr. Ballentine)
