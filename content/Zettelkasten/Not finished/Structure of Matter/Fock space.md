The orthonormal basis vectors of the state space (known as Fock space) consist of: the vacuum or no-particle state, $\ket{0}$; a complete set of one-particle state vectors, $\ket{\alpha}\equiv\ket{\phi_{\alpha}}, \alpha = 1,2,\dots$ where the label $\alpha$ is actually an abbreviation for all the quantum numbers needed to specify a unique state; a complete set of two-particle state vectors $\ket{\alpha\beta}\equiv\ket{\phi_{\alpha\beta}}, \alpha = 1,2,\dots,\beta = 1,2,\dots$; a complete set of three-particle state vectors; etc. However, these complete sets of many-particle states contain only vectors of the correct permutation symmetry, and hence they are complete within the appropriate permutation-invariant subspace. There is no need for them to span the full vector space , which is physically irrelevant in light of the symmetrization postulate (see [[Zettelkasten/Not finished/Structure of Matter/Identical particles]]). There are technical differences between the formalisms for fermions and for bosons, which make it convenient to treat the two cases separately
