### Homovalent impurities

Substitution happens with an atom with the same valence (i.e C $\to$ Si).
The net effect is that no new levels are created, but the electron scattering properties of the material changes.
There is one exception to this rule $GaAs_{1-x}N_x$ dilute nitride. 

### Substitutional impurities with 2 group differences

Suppose one wants to dope the material with a donor/acceptor with a 2 group difference from the main sample.
Then we expect a potential energy 2 times bigger and an energy level 4 times larger.
Also we note that in this context the envelope function method conditions are not fully respected.
These levels are usually $\sim 0.2\ \text{eV}$, so hard to ionize via thermal radiation. So in general they are not considered as doping levels and are called **deep levels** or **trap levels**.
**Note that, contrary to doping levels, deep levels can have 2 electrons per state.**
Note that even if they are not important in doping they are fundamental in the scattering process, because likely, given a sample some contaminants will have the effect to add deep levels to the system, as seen in the following example for typical contaminants in the Si production:

Note also that this effect amplifies the bigger the group difference is.

### Point defects

The presence of point defects in a semiconductors tend to generate in the band structure deep levels.
Dislocations are an important source of deep levels.

### Surfaces or interfaces

In general when one has a surface or an interface, this can introduce in the system generally deep, sometimes shallow additional levels:

We report in the following picture other interesting possibilities:
