The Zincblende is a multi-element structure closely related to the [[Zettelkasten/Not finished/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Diamond structure|Diamond structure]].

Has an atom of species A in the brown spots an atom of species B in the purple spots.
Same consideration on the crystal structure made on the diamond structure applies.
Of course the difference with the diamond structure is in the translation symmetry.

it describes the typical structure of a semiconductor compound and compound of the type III-V or II-VI. (Exceptions are nitrides and some $\text{SiC}$ phases)
in the case of 3 component alloys (e.g. $\text{Ga}_{1-x}\text{Al}_x\text{As}$, where $0<x<0.5$) we have the following: $\text{GaAs}$ and $\text{AlAs}$ are both III-V semiconductors. So the As occupies the V sub-lattice while Al and Ga occupy between themselves the III sub-lattice (each site of the sub-lattice with probability respectively $x$ and $1-x$).
