In order to remain sane I lay done what is needed in order to operate, maybe some interesting facts sprinkled in, but nothing more. Maybe I will return here after everything is over.
This piles up with [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Models of Theoretical Physics/Statistical mechanics/Working cheatsheet for Gradenigo's part|Working cheatsheet for Gradenigo's part]], in the eternal quest of me posticipating the study of Statistical Mechanics.

This course treats MD at equilibrium, so we will concerned only with equilibrium statistical mechanics in which the ergodic hypothesis is valid.
The natural ensemble to work in is the NVE ensemble (microcanonical). these are its characteristics:

We can also be interested in the NVT ensemble (canonical):

Also of interest, but less used are the $\mu$VT (gran-canonical), in which the system is not isolated:

Or the NPT (isothermal-isobaric):
