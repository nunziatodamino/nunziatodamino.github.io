The idea is that when we have a structure as a [[Bravais lattice]], this has established because between the nuclei a bond is present.

Many particular bonds are presents, but a broad classification can be made:

- [[Van der Waals bond]]
- [[Ionic bond]]
- [[Covalent bond]]
- [[Metallic bond]]
- [[Hydrogen bond]]
