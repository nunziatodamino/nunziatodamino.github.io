This dimensionless number is a measure of the geometric efficiency of a crystal. 
==Since atoms are approximately spheres, we want to know how much space they occupy compared to the total volume of the crystal==. This fraction is called the packing fraction (sometimes called filling fraction) , and each structure has its own. Here we list such values for notable structures, the reasoning that leads to these numbers can be found [here].

-   Simple cubic $f = 52 \%$
-   Body-centered cubic (BCC) $f = 68 \%$
-   Face-centered cubic (FCC) $f = 74 \%$
-   HCP $f = 74 \%$
-   Diamond $f = 34 \%$
