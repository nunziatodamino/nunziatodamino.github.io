If, on the other hand, we are more interested in the repulsive part of Pauli, that is, we want to study the behavior for $R << r_a$ or comparable to it, it is better to use another potential than the [[Lennard-Jones potential]].
We will use in the latter case the Born-Mayer potential:

$$U_{rep} = \lambda \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\rho}\right)$$

With $\lambda$ and $\rho$ experimental parameters.
We conclude by showing the difference between the 2 in a plot.
