#### Simple cubic lattice (Cubic P)
##### Atoms per unit cell

Taking the unit cell into consideration, we consider the atoms in their entirety and intersect them with the unit cell. We have 1/8 of an atom for each angle for 8 angles. So: 8 * 1/8 = 1 atom per unit cell.
##### Coordination number (nearest neighbour number)
Given an atom we have 4 nearest neighbour in the same atomic plane, and then 1 for the top plane and 1 bottom plane, so that $n.n. = 6$

#### Body centered cubic (BCC or Cubic I)
##### Atoms per unit cell![[Pasted image 20230213153345.png]]
We have this time, using the same ansatz, one more atom to account, together with the 1/8 of an atom for each angle for 8 angles. So that :1 + 8 * 1/8 = 2 atom per unit cell.
##### Coordination number (nearest neighbour number)
Given an atom (is useful to put use in the center og the BCC unit cell) we have 4 nearest neighbours for the top plane and again 4 for the bottom plane, so that $n.n. = 8$
#### Face centered cubic (FCC or Cubic F)
##### Atoms per unit cell

Here we DO NOT have an atom at the center, we have 1/8 of an atom for each angle and 1/2 atom for each face." So that : 6* 1/2 + 8 * 1/8 = 4 atom per unit cell.
##### Coordination number (nearest neighbour number)
I choose an atom in the center of a face (e.g. the top one). I have 4 nearest neighbours in the atomic plane. Below I have 4 more (the 4 centers of the faces) and above the same equal situation, so that $n.n. = 12$
