## 1. Cluster Expansion and Virial Equation

1.  What is the Mayer function, $f(r_{ij})$? How is it defined and what is its physical significance in the context of interacting particles?
2.  Starting from the canonical partition function for a system of N particles with pairwise interactions, show how the introduction of the Mayer function leads to the cluster expansion.
3.  Derive the virial equation of state up to the second virial coefficient, $B_2$. Show explicitly how $B_2$ is related to the integral of the Mayer function.
    $$ \frac{PV}{Nk_BT} = 1 + B_2(T)\\rho + O(\\rho^2) $$
4.  Explain the physical meaning of the second virial coefficient, $B_2(T)$. How does its sign and temperature dependence relate to the nature of the intermolecular forces (i.e., repulsive vs. attractive)?

## 2. Graph Theory and Higher-Order Terms

1.  What is the purpose of using graph notation in the cluster expansion? How does it help in organizing and calculating the higher-order terms of the partition function?
2.  Define what is meant by an "l-cluster" in the context of the graphical expansion. Why are these cluster integrals important?
3.  Explain the combinatorial factor that arises when summing over all possible N-particle graphs for a given set of cluster numbers ${m_l}$.
    $$ \frac{N!}{\prod_{l}(l!)^{m_l}m_l!} $$
4.  What is the general expression for the partition function $\mathcal{Q}_N$ in terms of the cluster integrals $b_l$?

## 3. Phenomenological Models

1.  What is the Clausius equation of state? How can it be seen as a phenomenological extrapolation of the virial series?
2.  Discuss the limitations of the Clausius equation. Why is it not a rigorously derived result?
