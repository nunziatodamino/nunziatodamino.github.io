Let us consider the effective Hamiltonian

$$\mathscr{H}\left[\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)\right]=\int d\vec{r}\left[\frac{k}{2}\left|\nabla\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)\right|^{2}+\frac{t}{2}\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)^{2}+g\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)^{6}\right]$$

where $k>0,g>0$ and $t\propto T.$ Within the saddle point approximation of the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory find

- The global minimum of $\mathscr{H}\left[\phi(\vec{r})\right]$ using the spatial homogeneous ansatz$\phi\left(\hat{r}\right)=m.$ Is there a phase transition at $t=0?$ Why?
- Calculate the magnetisation and the equilibrium free energy of the system $F=F\left(t\right)$ for $t>0$ and $t<0.$ Compute the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\alpha.$ 
- Calculate the susceptibility for $t<0$ and $t>0$ and derive the critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\delta.$

### Solution
1) By the saddle point approximation:

$$H\left[\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)\right]=\int d\vec{r}\left[\frac{k}{2}\left|\nabla\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)\right|^{2}+\frac{t}{2}\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)^{2}+g\phi\left(\vec{r}\right)^{6}\right] \sim \frac{k}{2}\left|\nabla\phi\left(\vec{r}_{min}\right)\right|^{2}+\frac{t}{2}\phi\left(\vec{r}_{min}\right)^{2}+g\phi\left(\vec{r}_{min}\right)^{6}$$

Using the constant order parameter ansatz this reduces to :

$$\mathscr{H}[m]\sim\frac{t}{2}m^{2}+gm^6$$

And then by minimizing:

$$ \frac{\partial \mathscr{H}}{\partial m } = 0 \iff mt+6gm^5 = 0 $$

Giving $m=0$ and $m_{\pm} = \pm\left(-\frac{t}{6g}\right)^{1/4}$. This last solution is valid only if $t \leq 0$
We distinguish 2 regimes:
- $t>0$ We have just one minima at $m=0$ (we can check it with the second derivative criterion)
- $t<0$ We have that $m=0$ is a local maxima while $m_{\pm}$ are global minima (always checking with the second derivative criterion)

Is there a phase transition at $t=0$? Yes. A phase transition occurs at $t=0$. Here's why:

   * For $t>0$ (high temperature), the system is in a disordered phase where the order parameter (magnetization) is zero ($m=0$).
   * For $t<0$ (low temperature), the system spontaneously picks one of the two degenerate ground states, $m \neq 0$. The system enters an ordered phase.

2) We already found the magnetization.
- For $t>0$ is $m=0$
- For $t<0$ is either one of the global minima, and one usually chooses the positive one by convenience $m= m_+$

The free energy is evaluated by definition of GL functional, as this functional assumes the value of the free energy when evaluated in the equilibrium order parameter.
- For $t>0$ clearly F(t) = 0
- For $t<0$:

$$F(t) = \frac{t}{2}\left(-\frac{t}{6g}\right)^{1/2}+g\left(-\frac{t}{6g}\right)^{3/2} \propto t^{3/2} $$

3) We saw that $m_+ \sim t^{1/4}$ so that $\beta = \frac{1}{4}$.
For $t>0$ we have $C(t) = 0$.
While for $t<0$, by definition of heat capacity, as $F(t) \propto t^{3/2}$

$$C(t) \propto t^{3/2-2} = t^{-1/2}\qquad\text{for t<0}$$

Concluding that $\alpha = 1/2$.

Optional) Considering the Legendre transform of the effective Hamiltonian and setting the equilibrium condition:

$$ \frac{\partial {\tilde{\mathscr{H}}}}{\partial m } = 0 \iff mt+6gm^5 = h $$

Leading to $\delta = 5$ as $t\to 0$.
From this we go swiftly to the susceptibility expression:

$$\chi = \frac{1}{\frac{\partial h}{\partial m}} = \frac{1}{t+30gm^4}$$ 
This is for $t>0$:

$$\chi(t) = \frac{1}{t} \sim t^{-1}$$
While for $t < 0$

$$\chi(t) = \frac{1}{t-5t} \sim t^{-1}$$

Concluding that $\gamma = 1$.
