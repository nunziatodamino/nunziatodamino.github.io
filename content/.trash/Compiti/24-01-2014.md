## Exercise 1
The truncated equation of state for a gas is given by
$$
P = k_B T n - \frac{b}{2} n^2 + \frac{c}{6} n^3 \tag{1}
$$

where $b$ and $c$ are positive functions of $T$ and $n = N/V$.

1) Find the critical temperature $T_c$ below which the equation of state ceases to be valid, and the corresponding critical values $n_c$ and $P_c$.

2) Compute the isothermal compressibility $k_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_T$ and determine the critical exponent $\gamma$ (the one governing the divergence of $k_T$ as $T\to T_c$).

3) On the critical isotherm ($T=T_c$), provide an expression for $P - P_c$ as a function of $(n - n_c)$.
### Solution

1) To find the critical parameters we consider the inflection point condition at the critical point:

$$ \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial n}\right)_{n=n_c} = 0 \qquad \left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial n^2}\right)_{n=n_c} = 0 $$

From this we find

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial n}\right)_{n=n_c} = 0 &\iff k_BT -bn + \frac{c}{2}n^2 = 0 \\
\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial n^2}\right)_{n=n_c} = 0 &\iff  -b + cn = 0 
\end{aligned}
$$

From this one finds, starting from the bottom:

$$ n_c =  \frac{b}{c} \qquad k_BT_c = bn_c - \frac{c}{2}n_c^2 = \frac{b^2}{c} -\frac{b^2}{2c} = \frac{b^2}{2c} $$

$$
P_c = k_B T_c n_c - \frac{b}{2} n_c^2 + \frac{c}{6} n_c^3 = \frac{b^3}{2c^2}- \frac{b^3}{2c^3} + \frac{b^3}{6c^2} = \frac{b^3}{6c^2}
$$

So that in the end:

$$ n_c =  \frac{b}{c} \qquad T_c = \frac{b^2}{2k_Bc} \qquad P_c = \frac{b^3}{6c^2} $$

2) We write :

$$k_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_T = -\frac{1}{V} \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \right)_T}$$

As $n = \frac{N}{V}$, then clearly $\frac{\partial}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial n}\frac{\partial n}{\partial V} = -\frac{N}{V^2}\frac{\partial P}{\partial n}$, so that:

$$k_T = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial n} \right)_T}$$

We already evaluated this before, so we have:

$$k_T = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{k_BT -bn + \frac{c}{2}n^2 } $$

Now, setting $t = \frac{T-T_c}{T_c} \iff T = T_c(t+1)$:

$$k_T = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{k_BT_C (t+1) -bn + \frac{c}{2}n^2 } $$

The only thing left to do is to evaluate the expression at the critical point, namely by evaluating it at $n = n_c$:

$$k_T = \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{k_BT_C (t+1) -bn_c + \frac{c}{2}n_c^2 } $$

In the end we have found

$$k_T \sim t^{-1} $$

Concluding that $\gamma =1$.


3) We begin by rewriting our initial equation respect the dimensionless parameter:

$$ \eta =\frac{n-n_c}{n_c}\quad t=\frac{T-T_c}{T_c} \quad \pi =\frac{P-P_c}{P_c}  $$

So that we have:

$$P_c(\pi+1) = k_B n_cT_c(t+1) (\eta+1) - n^2_c\frac{b}{2} (\eta+1)^2 + n_c^3\frac{c}{6}(\eta+1) n^3$$

We begin the simplification. We set for simplicity $A = \frac{k_B n_cT_c}{P_c}$, $B = - n^2_c\frac{b}{2P_c}$ and $C= n_c^3\frac{c}{6}$:

$$\pi =-1 + A(t+1) (\eta+1) + B (\eta+1)^2 + C(\eta+1)^3$$

Now we focus on the critical isotherm $t = 0$:

$$\pi =-1 + A (\eta+1) + B (\eta+1)^2 + C(\eta+1)^3$$

Now we evaluate $A,B,C$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{k_B n_c T_c}{P_c} = \frac{k_B \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{b^2}{2 c k_B}}{ \frac{b^3}{6 c^2} } = \frac{ \frac{b^3}{2 c^2} }{ \frac{b^3}{6 c^2} } = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 = 3 \\
B &= -\frac{n_c^2 b}{2 P_c} = -\frac{ \left( \frac{b}{c} \right)^2 \cdot b }{2 \cdot \frac{b^3}{6 c^2}} = -\frac{ \frac{b^3}{c^2} }{ \frac{b^3}{3 c^2} } = -3 \\
C &= \frac{n_c^3 c}{6 P_c} = \frac{ \left( \frac{b}{c} \right)^3 \cdot c }{6 \cdot \frac{b^3}{6 c^2} } = \frac{ \frac{b^3}{c^3} \cdot c }{ \frac{b^3}{c^2} } = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Then one has simply:

$$\pi =-1 + 3 (\eta+1) -3 (\eta+1)^2 + (\eta+1)^3$$

By expanding one finds:

$$ \pi = \eta^3 $$

Which is the final answer (leading also to the consideration that $\delta = 3$).
We observe for the critical exponents that we obtained the same result of the mean field method.

## Exercise 2
  
Consider the ferromagnetic Ising model in which each spin can take three values $S_i = 0, \pm 1$.

a) Find the mean-field equations for the free energy and the magnetization.  
b) Determine the critical temperature and the behavior near the critical point. Are the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\delta$ the same as in the case $S_i = \pm 1$?
c) Is the free energy lower or higher than that of the $S_i = \pm 1$ case? Why?
d) Expand the free energy to fourth order in the magnetization. Does the resulting polynomial have the same form as the Landau free‐energy introduced for the $S_i = \pm 1$ Ising case?

 Useful expansions: $\sinh(x)\sim x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots$ , $\tanh(x)\sim x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \dots$ 

### Solution

a) Whatever the possible spin configurations, the Hamiltonian for the Ising model in the mean field approximation is:

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
-\beta\mathscr{H} 
&= -\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J +(mz\hat{J} +h) \sum_i  s_i 
\end{aligned}
$$

So now is just a matter of evaluating the canonical partition function:

$$ \mathcal{Z}_N = \text{Tr} e^{-\beta\mathscr{H}} = \sum_{\{s\}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J +(mzJ +h) \sum_i  s_i }  $$

So we proceed as usual: 

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{Z}_N &= \sum_{\{s\}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J +(mzJ +h) \sum_i  s_i } = e^{-\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J}\sum_{\{s\}} e^{(mzJ +h) \sum_i  s_i }  = \\
&= e^{-\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J} \prod_{i} \sum_{s = 0, \pm1} e^{(mzJ +h)  s_i } =e^{-\frac{1}{2}Nzm^2 J}[1+2\cosh(mzJ +h)]^N


\end{aligned}
$$

And from this we can evaluate the bulk free energy: 

$$ N\beta f_b = -\ln \mathcal{Z}_N \iff f_b = \frac{1}{2}k_BTzm^2 J - k_BT\ln[1+2\cosh(mzJ +h)]$$

And the magnetization:

$$m = \left(-\frac{\partial f_b}{\partial H}\right)_T = \left(-\beta\frac{\partial f_b}{\partial h}\right)_T  = \frac{2\sinh(mzJ +h)}{1+2\cosh(mzJ +h)} $$

b) We begin by finding the critical temperature by linearizing the self consistent equation around the critical point $m=0, h=0$. Is also better to recover explicitly the temperature dependency by the relations $\beta\hat{J} = J$ and $\beta H = h$.
Given that $\sinh(x) \sim x$ and $\cosh(x) \sim 1$, we have:

$$m \sim \frac{2(\beta mz\hat{J})}{1+2} \iff \beta_C = \frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{z\hat{J}}$$

From which one can find the expression for $T_C = \frac{k_B}{\beta_C}$

For the critical exponents we can proceed in a smart way: if we prove that the bulk free energy has the same Landau expansion of the spin-1 Ising model than we can state that it will predict the same critical exponents.
So we do first point d).

d) Again we recover explicitly the temperature dependency by the relations $\beta\hat{J} = J$ and $\beta H = h$ and write:

$$ f_b = \frac{1}{2}zm^2 \hat{J} - k_BT\ln[1+2\cosh\beta(mz\hat{J} +H)]$$

We now call $\beta m z\hat{J} \equiv x$. As $T\to T_C$ we have that $x \to 0$.

So we expand now the bulk free energy in the zero field limit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_b &= \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln[1+2\cosh(x)] = \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln\left[1+2\left( 1+\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \mathcal{O}(x^6) \right)\right] = \\

&= \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln\left[ 3+\frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \mathcal{O}(x^6) \right] =  \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln\left[ 3\left(1+\frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{x^4}{36} + \mathcal{O}(x^6)\right) \right] \\

&= \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln3 - \frac{1}{\beta}\left[ \left(\frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{x^4}{36} + \mathcal{O}(x^6)\right) -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{x^4}{36} + \mathcal{O}(x^6)\right)^2 + \mathcal{O}(x^6) \right] = \\

&= \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}}x^2 - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln3 - \frac{1}{\beta}\left[\frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{x^4}{36}- \frac{x^4}{18} + \mathcal{O}(x^6) \right] = \\

&= - \frac{1}{\beta}\ln3  + \left(\frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}} -\frac{1}{3\beta}\right)x^2 + \frac{36}{\beta}x^4 + \mathcal{O}(x^6)
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we can conclude by setting $\tilde{f}_b = f_b +\frac{1}{\beta}\ln3$, $A = \frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}} -\frac{1}{3\beta}$ and $B = \frac{36}{\beta}$:

$$ \tilde{f}_b = Ax^2 +Bx^4 + \mathcal{O}(x^6) $$

And recast all in function of the order parameter through $\beta m z\hat{J} \equiv x$.
Doing this we observe that only the coefficient $A$ :

$$ A = \beta z \hat{J}\left(\frac{1}{2\beta^2 z\hat{J}} -\frac{1}{3\beta}\right) = \frac{1}{2\beta}-\frac{z\hat{J}}{3} = \frac{1}{2\beta}-\frac{1}{2\beta_C} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\beta-\beta_c}{\beta\beta_c} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1-\frac{T}{T_c}}{\beta_c} = \frac{1}{2\beta_C}(-t) $$

(Where $t = \frac{T-T_C}{T_C}$ is the reduced temperature) is temperature dependent and changes signs properly according to the different temperature regimes. Also is clear that $B>0$ an t independent, guaranteeing the free energy stability.  
Now we can finish point b) as this is the same Landau form for the free energy in the spin-1 Ising model, the critical exponent predicted will be the same, so $\beta = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\delta =3$.

c) One can compare analytically the 2 expression for the free energy and realize that the one we have is lower than the spin-1 Ising model.
This is though useless. As the extra spin in this model rises the configurational entropy, the free energy will be naturally lower, without calculations.

## Exercise 3 

Calculate the second virial coefficient for the two-body potential

$$
\phi(r) = \begin{cases}
\infty, & r < \sigma \\
-\epsilon, & \sigma < r < \sigma + \delta \\
0, & r > \sigma + \delta
\end{cases}
$$

Then simplify the expression in the case of sufficiently high temperature compared to the well depth $\epsilon$, that is for $\beta \epsilon \ll 1$.
### Solution

The second virial coefficient is given by the formula:

$$B_2 = -2\pi\int_{0}^{+\infty} dr\ r^2f(r) = -2\pi\int_{0}^{+\infty} dr\ r^2 (e^{-\beta\phi(r)}-1) $$

So we evaluate this integral. We have:

$$B_2  = 2\pi \left[ \int_{0}^{\sigma} dr\ r^2 -\int_{\sigma}^{\sigma+\delta} dr\ r^2 (e^{\beta\varepsilon}-1) \right] = \frac{2\pi}{3} \left[ \sigma^3- (e^{\beta\varepsilon}-1)((\sigma+\delta)^3-\sigma^3) \right] $$

Or, in the high temperature limit:

$$B_2 \sim \frac{2\pi}{3} \left[ \sigma^3- \beta\varepsilon((\sigma+\delta)^3-\sigma^3) \right] $$
