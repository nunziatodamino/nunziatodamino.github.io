“The virial expansion is an exact combinatorial cluster procedure; a mean‑field approach instead predicts a simple functional form in which all those combinatorial details are smeared into one or two effective parameters.”

A note on the effective Hamiltonian.
In literature
$$ \mathscr{F}_{\text{eff}} =\beta\mathscr{H}_{\text{eff}} = \int d^dr\ \left[\mathscr{L}(\phi(\bar{r})) +\frac{K}{2} (\nabla\phi(\bar{r}))^2 \right]  $$

But one can include the $\beta$ in the parameters of $\mathscr{L}$ and $K$ by redefinition and write, say

$$ \mathscr{F}_{\text{eff}} =\mathscr{H}_{\text{eff}}' = \int d^dr\ \left[\mathscr{L}'(\phi(\bar{r})) +\frac{K'}{2} (\nabla\phi(\bar{r}))^2 \right]  $$

In texts, when referring to an effective Hamiltonian there is in general no way to know what definition is used in principle.
Confusingly, is used more often the second one.
