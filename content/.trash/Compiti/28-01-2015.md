## Exercise 1

Recent work on the thermodynamics of black holes has suggested that a charged black hole with charge $Q$ satisfies the following equation of state:

$$
P = \frac{T}{v} - \frac{1}{2\pi v^2} + \frac{2Q^2}{\pi v^4} \tag{1}
$$

where $v = V/n$ is the specific volume.  
Find the critical point of this equation of state and the critical exponents $\delta$ and $\beta$.

(**Hint**: To find the critical exponents, once the critical point $(P_c, T_c, v_c)$ has been found, it is useful to rewrite the equation of state in terms of the variables $p = P/P_c$, etc., and then expand in a power series around small displacements from the critical point.)

## Exercise 2

Write the self-consistency equations for the magnetization in the mean-field approximation for the following systems:

- Ferromagnetic Ising model on a 2D triangular lattice:

$$
\beta \mathcal{H} = K \sum_{\langle r, r' \rangle} S_r S_{r'} + h \sum_r S_r \tag{2}
$$

For this specific case, study the self-consistency equation of the magnetization either graphically or using a small-$m$ expansion, and draw the phase diagram (i.e., the location of phase transitions). In particular, find the critical point.

(First discuss the case $h = 0$, then the case with small $h > 0$ where the behavior of magnetic susceptibility can be deduced.)

- Ising model in $d$ dimensions with Hamiltonian:

$$
\beta \mathcal{H} = K \sum_{\langle r, r' \rangle} S_r S_{r'} + h \sum_r S_r + K' \sum_{\langle r, r', r'', r''' \rangle} S_r S_{r'} S_{r''} S_{r'''} \tag{3}
$$

where the term $K'$ refers to an interaction between spins that reside on the plaquettes of the hypercubic lattice. Once the general self-consistency equation has been found, discuss the phase diagram as in the previous case, but specifically for $h=0$, $K'=0$

### Solution

1) Triangular lattice

In this model nothing changes respect the usual mean field case, only the fact that for a triangular lattice the coordination number is $z=6$. 
So we have the usual self consistence equation:

$$ m = \tanh(\beta(mz\hat{J} +h)) $$

From this one can find easily the critical point. Setting $h=0$ and linearizing the equation:

$$ m \simeq 6\beta m \hat{J} \iff \beta_{C} = \frac{1}{6\hat{J}}  \iff T_C = \frac{6\hat{J}}{k_B} $$

If we instead linearize for $h \neq 0$ we find :

$$ m \simeq \beta(mz\hat{J} +h)-\frac{1}{3}[\beta(mz\hat{J} +h)]^3 + \mathcal{O}(m^5,h^5) $$

From this one can evaluate the magnetic susceptibility (even if technically the exercise did not ask it):

$$ \chi(h) = \frac{\partial m}{\partial h} = \beta-[\beta(mz\hat{J} +h)]^2 + \mathcal{O}(m^5,h^4)  $$

And in the static case $h=0$ its critical exponent (given $t = \frac{T-T_C}{T_C} \iff T =T_C(t+1)$ then $\frac{k_B}{\beta} =T \iff \beta = \frac{k_B}{T_C(t+1)}$):

$$ \chi(0) \simeq \frac{k_B}{T_C(t+1)} \sim t^{-1} $$

Which is of course the mean field exponent as expected.

2) D-dimensional Ising with higher order interactions

Again we want to build the self consistent equation.
Given that the first 2 terms are the usual term that will lead to the well known self consistent equation (i.e. the one above) we just have to study the contribution of the higher order term.
The idea is

$$ 
s_is_js_ks_r = s_i\braket{s_js_ks_r} =m^3s_i 
$$

So that when evaluating the Hamiltonian we have the additional term :

$$ \beta\mathscr{H}_\text{higher order} = m^3K' \sum_is_i $$

Leading to the self consistent equation:

$$ m = \tanh(\beta(mz\hat{J} +h+m^3K')) $$

As the additional term is of the same order of the field term.
Again, one can linearize in $m$ with $h=0$, $K'=0$ to find

$$ k_BT_C = z\hat{J} $$

Where this time, given that we are on a hypercubic lattice $z=2d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality.
For a general expansion:

$$ m =\simeq \beta(mz\hat{J} +h+m^3K') -\frac{1}{3}\beta(mz\hat{J} +h+m^3K')^3  + \mathcal{O}(m^5,h^5,K^5)$$

With the same ansatz as before one finds:

$$ \chi(0) \sim \beta \sim t^{-1} $$

#### A note on the plots

There are different ways to plot a phase diagram. We are used to $m$ vs $T$ but in an exam to think to plot this is crazy behavior.
One should instead plot the way easier $H$ vs $T$ that is just a line:

Here the 2 phase diagram in the same plot where the temperature is expressed in units of $k_B$. Of course we choose $d=2$. Note that the higher order interactions do not change the critical temperature, while the Bravais lattice underneath does.
