## 1. Correlation Functions

1.  Define the two-point correlation function, $G(\bar{R}, \tau)$, and the connected correlation function, $G_c(\bar{R}, \tau)$. What is the physical significance of the connected correlation function?
2.  What does it mean for a random field to be stationary and homogeneous? How do these properties simplify the form of the correlation function?
3.  Why is the concept of a correlation function important in the study of phase transitions?

## 2. Mathematical Tools

1.  Write down the Taylor expansion for $\ln(1+x)$ and state the region of convergence. In what kind of physical calculation might this expansion be useful?
2.  Write down the Taylor expansion for $\tanh(x)$. Where is this used in the context of the mean-field Ising model?
3.  What is the general form of the Fourier transform of a function $f(\bar{r})$ in d-dimensional space?
4.  What is a Green's function? How is it used to solve inhomogeneous differential equations?

## 3. Phase Transitions and Analyticity

1.  How is the analyticity of the free energy related to the order of a phase transition?
2.  For a second-order phase transition, which derivative of the free energy is expected to be discontinuous?
3.  Explain how the free energy $F(t)$ near a critical point can be decomposed into an analytic part, $F_{an}(t)$, and a singular part, $F_{sin}(t)$. What is the role of each part?
