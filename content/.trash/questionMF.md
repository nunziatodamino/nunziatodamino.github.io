## I. Fundamental Concepts of Mean-Field Theory

1.  What is the core assumption of the mean-field approximation? How does this assumption simplify the treatment of many-body systems?
2.  Explain the physical meaning of neglecting the correlation between fluctuations of the order parameter. What is the mathematical expression of this approximation?
3.  What are the main limitations of mean-field theory? In what physical regime do you expect it to fail and why?
4.  State the Ginzburg criterion. How is it used to determine the validity of the mean-field approximation?
5.  What is the significance of the upper critical dimension, $d_c$? Calculate its value for the Ising model using the mean-field critical exponents.

## II. Variational Approach

1.  State the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman inequality, which is the foundation of the variational approach in statistical mechanics.
2.  What is the mean-field approximation for the N-particle probability distribution function, $\rho(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_N)$?
3.  Using the variational principle and the mean-field approximation for the PDF, derive the expression for the mean-field free energy functional, $\mathscr{F}^{MF}_\rho$.

## III. The Ising Model in Mean-Field Theory

1.  Starting from the Ising Hamiltonian, apply the mean-field approximation to derive the effective mean-field Hamiltonian.
2.  Derive the self-consistent equation for the magnetization, $m = \tanh(\beta(mz\hat{J} + h))$, for the mean-field Ising model.
3.  Sketch the graphical solution for the self-consistent equation for $h=0$ and explain how it predicts a phase transition.
4.  Starting from the expansion of the bulk free energy near the critical temperature, derive the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for the mean-field Ising model.
5.  Explain why the specific heat $C_H$ shows a finite discontinuity at the critical temperature in the mean-field Ising model, leading to a critical exponent $\alpha=0$.

## IV. The Van der Waals Model

1.  How is the Van der Waals equation of state derived from a simple mean-field potential for liquids that includes a hard-sphere repulsion and a uniform attractive interaction?
2.  Analyze the Van der Waals isotherms for $T > T_C$, $T = T_C$, and $T < T_C$. Why is the isotherm for $T < T_C$ considered unphysical?
3.  What is the physical meaning of the order parameter $\Delta \nu = \nu_g - \nu_l$ in the context of the liquid-gas phase transition?
4.  Explain the purpose of the Maxwell (equal area) construction. Derive the equal area rule from the condition of chemical potential equality along the coexistence curve.
5.  What is the law of corresponding states? How does it demonstrate a universality among different fluids?

## V. Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theories

1.  What are the fundamental assumptions of the Landau theory of phase transitions?
2.  For a system with up-down symmetry (like the Ising model), explain why the Landau free energy expansion can only contain even powers of the order parameter $\eta$.
3.  How can the Landau theory be modified to describe a first-order phase transition? What is the role of the cubic term in the free energy expansion?
4.  What new physical aspect does the Ginzburg-Landau theory introduce compared to the Landau theory? What is the physical significance of the gradient term, $(\nabla\phi)^2$, in the Ginzburg-Landau functional?
5.  Explain the concept of "coarse-graining" and how it can be used to formally derive the Ginzburg-Landau functional.
6.  Derive the equilibrium condition for the order parameter in Ginzburg-Landau theory (the Euler-Lagrange equation). How does this lead to a differential equation for the two-point correlation function?
