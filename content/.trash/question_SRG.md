## 1. Scaling Hypotheses

1.  State Widom's scaling hypothesis for the singular part of the free energy. What does it mean for a function to be a generalized homogeneous function?
2.  Using Widom's scaling hypothesis, derive the scaling relations between the critical exponents:
    *   Rushbrooke's relation: $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma = 2$
    *   Griffith's relation: $\alpha + \beta(\delta + 1) = 2$
3.  What is the Kadanoff block-spin transformation? How does it provide a physical motivation for the scaling hypotheses?
4.  Explain the hyperscaling relation, $2 - \alpha = \nu d$. What is its significance?

## 2. The Renormalization Group (RG)

1.  What are the two main steps of a real-space renormalization group (RSRG) transformation?
2.  What is a fixed point of an RG transformation? Distinguish between trivial and critical fixed points.
3.  How does the correlation length, $\xi$, behave under an RG transformation? What does this imply about the correlation length at a critical fixed point?
4.  Explain the concept of a basin of attraction in the space of Hamiltonians. How does this relate to the concept of universality?
5.  How are critical exponents related to the eigenvalues of the linearized RG transformation near a critical fixed point? Explain the terms "relevant," "irrelevant," and "marginal" operators.

## 3. Applications

1.  Describe the steps involved in performing an RSRG calculation for the 1D Ising model.
2.  How can the RG flow diagram in the space of coupling constants be used to identify the different phases of a system and the nature of the phase transitions between them?
