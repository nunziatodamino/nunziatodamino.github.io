## 1. Fundamental Concepts

1.  What is the fundamental problem of thermodynamics?
2.  What is an equilibrium state? What is a steady state?
3.  Distinguish between extensive and intensive variables. Provide two examples of each.
4.  What is the thermodynamic limit (Van Hove limit)? Why is it important in statistical mechanics?

## 2. Laws of Thermodynamics and Potentials

1.  State the entropy maximum postulates. How do they solve the fundamental problem of thermodynamics?
2.  What is the Third Law of Thermodynamics? What does it imply about the entropy of a system at absolute zero?
3.  How are the intensive parameters (temperature, pressure, chemical potential) defined as derivatives of the internal energy, $U(S, V, N)$?
4.  Starting from the homogeneity of the internal energy, derive the Euler equation: $U = TS - pV + \sum_i \mu_i N_i$.
5.  Derive the Gibbs-Duhem relation. What does it imply about the relationships between the intensive parameters?

## 3. Phase Transitions

1.  Define the following critical exponents: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\nu$, and $\eta$. What physical quantity does each exponent describe?
2.  Sketch the behavior of the Gibbs free energy, entropy, and specific heat as a function of temperature for a first-order and a second-order phase transition.
