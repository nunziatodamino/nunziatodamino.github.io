## 1. General Theory

1.  According to the Ehrenfest classification, what defines a first-order phase transition? What defines a second-order phase transition? Provide a physical example for each.
2.  What is an order parameter? Give examples of order parameters for the liquid-gas transition and the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition.
3.  What is the lower critical dimension? What are the lower critical dimensions for systems with discrete and continuous global symmetries?
4.  How can the free energy of a finite system be decomposed into bulk and surface contributions? Why is this decomposition useful?

## 2. Models and Symmetries

1.  What is the O(n) model? How does it relate to the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models?
2.  Describe the global symmetries of the Ising model, the Potts model, and the XY model.
3.  What is the significance of the Perron-Frobenius theorem in the context of phase transitions? Why does a system whose transfer matrix satisfies the theorem's conditions not exhibit a phase transition?

## 3. The Zipper Model

1.  Describe the single-ended zipper model. What physical phenomenon is it intended to model?
2.  Derive the partition function for the single-ended zipper model with a constant degeneracy G for each open link.
3.  How does the average number of open links, $\braket{k}$, behave as a function of temperature? What is the significance of the critical temperature $T_C = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{k_B \ln G}$?

## 4. The BKT Transition

1.  What is the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition? How is it different from a conventional phase transition with long-range order?
2.  In the low-temperature approximation of the 2D XY model, what is the form of the energy cost associated with a spin wave, $\Delta E$? What is the spin stiffness?
3.  What is a vortex in the 2D XY model? What is its topological charge?
4.  Provide the free energy argument for the creation of a single vortex. How does this lead to the BKT transition temperature, $T_{BKT} = \frac{J\pi}{2k_B}$?
