## I. Foundational Concepts

1.  What is the fundamental problem that statistical mechanics aims to solve, particularly for systems with a high number of degrees of freedom?
2.  Distinguish between a microstate and a macrostate. Provide a clear example for a simple system like a gas in a box.
3.  What is a statistical ensemble? Why is this concept useful in statistical mechanics?
4.  State and explain the Ergodic Hypothesis. What is its importance in connecting microscopic dynamics to macroscopic thermodynamics?
5.  What is the Fundamental Postulate of Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics (the principle of equal a priori probabilities)? To which type of ensemble does it directly apply?

## II. Ensembles and Partition Functions

1.  Describe the microcanonical ensemble. What are the fixed macroscopic variables that define it? What is the form of the probability distribution, $\rho$, in this ensemble?
2.  Describe the canonical ensemble (NVT). How is it different from the microcanonical ensemble? What are the fixed macroscopic variables?
3.  Derive the Boltzmann distribution, $\rho_{eq} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}}e^{-\beta\mathscr{H}}$, for the canonical ensemble by considering a small system in thermal contact with a large heat reservoir.
4.  What is the canonical partition function, $\mathcal{Z}$? Explain how it acts as a bridge between microscopic states and macroscopic thermodynamic properties.
5.  For a system of N non-interacting, distinguishable particles, show how the total partition function $\mathcal{Z}_N$ can be decomposed into the product of single-particle partition functions, $\mathcal{Z}_1$. How does this change for indistinguishable particles?
6.  Explain the concept of Liouville's theorem. What does it imply about the density of states in phase space over time?

## III. Applications and Thermodynamic Connections

1.  Starting from the canonical partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, derive the expressions for the following thermodynamic quantities:
    *   Helmholtz Free Energy (F)
    *   Internal Energy (U or E)
    *   Entropy (S)
    *   Pressure (P)
2.  What are the main types of statistical ensembles used in statistical mechanics? Briefly describe the physical situation that each ensemble is designed to model (i.e., what are the constraints on the system?).
