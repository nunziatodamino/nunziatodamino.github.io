## 1. The Model and Its Properties

1.  Write down the Hamiltonian for the spin-1 Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions and an external magnetic field.
2.  What is the global symmetry of the Ising model Hamiltonian in the absence of an external magnetic field? How does this symmetry imply that the magnetization must be zero for a finite system?
3.  Explain the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the context of the Ising model. How is the thermodynamic limit crucial for this phenomenon?
4.  What is the order parameter for the Ising model? How is it related to the derivatives of the free energy?

## 2. The 1D Ising Model

1.  Using the recursive method, derive the partition function for the 1D Ising model with free boundary conditions and no external magnetic field.
2.  What is the transfer matrix? How can it be used to calculate the partition function for the 1D Ising model with periodic boundary conditions?
3.  Show that the bulk free energy of the 1D Ising model is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.
4.  Why does the 1D Ising model not exhibit a phase transition at any finite temperature? Explain this using both the transfer matrix formalism (i.e., the properties of its eigenvalues) and the energy-entropy argument.

## 3. The 2D Ising Model

1.  Provide the Peierls (or energy-entropy) argument for the existence of a phase transition in the 2D Ising model. How does the dimensionality of the system play a key role in this argument?
2.  How is the transfer matrix method generalized to the 2D Ising model? What are the dimensions of the transfer matrix in this case?

## 4. Correlation Functions and Response

1.  How is the k-point correlation function, $\braket{s_{i_1} \dots s_{i_k}}$, related to the derivatives of the partition function with respect to the local magnetic fields, $h_i$?
2.  State the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the Ising model. What is the relationship between the two-point connected correlation function, $G_c(i,j)$, and the magnetic susceptibility, $\chi_{ij}$?
3.  How is the correlation length, $\xi$, related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix?

## 5. Theorems and Concepts

1.  What is the Mermin-Wagner theorem? Why does it not apply to the 2D Ising model?
2.  What is the Ginzburg criterion for the validity of mean-field theory in the context of the Ising model?
