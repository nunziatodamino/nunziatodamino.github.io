# Annotations and Corrections for Miscellanea Notes

This document contains corrections and clarifications for the notes in the 'Miscellanea' directory.

## 1. Empty Files

Two files in this directory are currently empty:

*   `Fourier transforms in any dimension.md`
*   `Notable Green's functions.md`

These files should be populated with the relevant mathematical formulas and definitions. For example, `Fourier transforms in any dimension.md` should contain the definitions of the forward and inverse Fourier transforms in d-dimensional space, and `Notable Green's functions.md` should list the Green's functions for common differential operators like the Laplacian and the Helmholtz operator.

## 2. AI-Generated Content

The file `Analyticity of the free energy in second-order phase transitions (optional).md` is marked as AI-generated. While the content appears correct, it would be beneficial to review it for accuracy and consistency with the other notes.

## 3. Suggestions for Improvement

*   The file `Expansions and recurring formulas.md` is a useful reference. It could be improved by adding a brief explanation of the context in which each expansion is typically used in statistical mechanics (e.g., high-temperature expansions, low-density expansions).
*   The file `Correlation functions.md` could be enhanced by providing a concrete example of how a correlation function is calculated for a simple system, such as the 1D Ising model.
