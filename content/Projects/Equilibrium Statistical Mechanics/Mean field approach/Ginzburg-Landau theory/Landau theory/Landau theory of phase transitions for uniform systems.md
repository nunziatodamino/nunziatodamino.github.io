Is a phenomenological mean field theory based on the following assumptions:

1) Exists for the system an **uniform** (does not vary along space) order parameter $\eta$, i.e. a quantity that:

$$ 
\begin{cases}
\eta \neq 0 & \text{if}\ T<T_c \\
\eta = 0 & \text{if}\ T\ge T_c \\
\end{cases}
$$

2) The system free energy $\mathscr{L}$ is an analytic function of the order parameter

 $$ \mathscr{L} = \mathscr{L}(\eta)  $$
 
 3) The function $\mathscr{L}$ must satisfy the underlying system's symmetry
 4) The equilibrium states coincides with the **absolute minima** of the function $\mathscr{L}$

Note that given Hp. 1, we are interested in the function $\mathscr{L}$ in the neighborhood of $\eta = 0$.
Than by Hp. 2 the following expansion is possible:

$$ \mathscr{L}(\eta) = a_0 + a_1\eta + a_2\eta^2 + \dots \qquad \forall \eta \in B(\eta=0,\rho)$$
