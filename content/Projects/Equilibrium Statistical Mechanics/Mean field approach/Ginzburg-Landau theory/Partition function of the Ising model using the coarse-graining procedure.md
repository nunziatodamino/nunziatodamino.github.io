The idea of this note is to evaluate the partition function of the Ising model using the coarse-graining procedure.
This consist broadly in the evaluatation of the effective Hamiltonian as defined in [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Mean field approach/Ginzburg-Landau theory/Partition function coarse-graining|Partition function coarse-graining]], as the partition function is defined:

$$\mathcal{Z}_N  =\sum_{m(\bar{r})}  e^{-\beta\mathscr{H}_{eff}} =\sum_{m(\bar{r})} \sum_{s \ \text {coarse}} e^{-\beta\mathscr{H}(s)}   $$

Note that in this case $m(\bar{r})$ is the average value of magnetization per cell.
