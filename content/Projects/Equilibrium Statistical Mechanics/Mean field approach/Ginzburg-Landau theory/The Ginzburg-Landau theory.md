Suppose we consider the following decomposition for order parameter for a system :

$$ \phi(\bar{r}) = \braket{\phi(\bar{r})} + \delta\phi(\bar{r}) $$

In this way we can recast [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Mean field approach/Mean field approximation|Mean field approximation]] as equivalent to the condition:

$$
(\delta\phi)^2 \sim (\delta\phi)^3 \sim \dots \sim (\delta\phi)^n \sim 0
$$

Consider now the following functional, called the **Ginzburg-Landau functional**:

$$ \mathfrak{F} = \int_V d\bar{r}\ \left[ \alpha\phi^2 + \frac{\beta}{2}\phi^4 \right] $$
