In general we saw that is not always possible to solve exactly models, especially as the dimension increases.
So we have to employ some type of approximation.

**One of the most successful is the mean field approximation: we neglect the correlation between fluctuations of the order parameter**

So, if $S$ is the system's order parameter, in a mean field approximation :

$$ (S_i-\braket{S_i})(S_j-\braket{S_j}) \simeq 0 \qquad \forall i,j $$

I.e. fluctuations at site $i$ does not influence fluctuations at site $j$ (i.e. are not correlated)
