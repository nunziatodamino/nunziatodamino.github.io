We saw from different mean field theories in liquids, that in the limit of low density :

$$ \frac{PV}{Nk_BT} = 1+B_2\rho^2 + \mathcal{O}(\rho^3) $$

We saw this in [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Mean field approach/Weakly interacting particles - Cluster expansion|Weakly interacting particles - Cluster expansion]] or in the general [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Mean field approach/Virial expansion in mean field liquids|Virial expansion in mean field liquids]].
Now, one can make the educated guess that this continues as a geometric series :

$$ \frac{PV}{Nk_BT} = 1+B_2\rho^2 + B^2_2\rho^3 + \dots = \frac{1}{1-B_2\rho} $$

Why you ask ? Why not . This was the basis for the **Clausius equation** : because many system behave like this at the first order, maybe at higher order it will continue to behave like this. 
I think this crazy approach is just due to the fear to deal to deal with the real calculation (see [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Mean field approach/Graph notation in the cluster expansion|Graph notation in the cluster expansion]]).
Moreover one cannot prove neither an upper or lower bound: for some system this is an overestimation, for some an underestimation.
