For a given thermodynamical system $\Omega$ it exists a function of [[Difference between extensive and intensive variables]], defined for every [[Equilibrium state (Thermodynamics)]] :
$$ S=S(U, V, N_1, \dots, N_r) $$
That satisfies the following:
- $S$ is additive : given a subsystem $\alpha \subset \Omega$ 
 $$ S = \sum_{\alpha}S^{(\alpha)} \qquad \mbox{where}\quad S^{(\alpha)}=S^{(\alpha)}(U^{(\alpha)}, V^{(\alpha)}, N_1^{(\alpha)}, \dots, N_r^{(\alpha)})$$

- $S$ is differentiable and monotonically increasing with respect to the internal energy U

In a formal contruction of Thermodynamics this is a postulate [[Herbert B. Callen - Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics-Wiley (1985).pdf#page=45]]
