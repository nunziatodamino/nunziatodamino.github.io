Let's consider the [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/The Ising Model/The spin-1 Ising model|The spin-1 Ising model]]. In most cases we considered the nearest neighbors approximation, i.e. a short range interaction between the spins.
This can be generalized if we consider:

$$ J_{ij} = \frac{J}{|| \bar{r_i}-\bar{r_i} ||^{\alpha}} $$

In this way the range of the interaction depends on the exponent $\alpha$.
We distinguish the following cases:

-  $\alpha > 2+\varepsilon \to$ equivalent to the short range
-  $1\leq \alpha \leq 2 \to$ long range
-  $\alpha <1 \to$ thermodynamic limit does not exists

**Note that range changes things respect to phase transitions. For example is possible to have long range order in $d=1$ if we consider long range order interactions.**

*Note that there is also the limiting case of the infinite long range interaction, i.e. the interaction is infinite and does not decrease in strength as distance increases.*
