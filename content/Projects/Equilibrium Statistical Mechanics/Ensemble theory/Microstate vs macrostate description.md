Imagine to have an isolated system of $N$ particles. We have different ways to describe this system.

One possible way is to specify at a specific instant of time $t$ all the generalized coordinates $q(t)$ and all the conjugated momenta $p(t)$ of the $N$ constituents. 
This kind of description, i.e. ==the specification of a point in the phase space $\Gamma$ is called microstate description, or simply microstate.==

Another way is to define some [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics/Difference between extensive and intensive variables|extensive properties]] of the system, i.e. specify the system total energy $E$, its volume $V$, etc.
Suppose one needs $m$ extensive variables in order to describe the system, one chooses to describe the system as an m-uple $M = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ 
This kind of description, i.e. ==the m-uple specification of extensive variables is called macrostate description, or simply macrostate.==
The number $m$ is small due to the [[Gibbs phase rule]].

We start by the easy, yet important observation: the dimension of the phase space $\Gamma$ is much larger than the dimension of the space to which the macrostate $M$ belongs.

A simple example is a mole of atoms where $(N,V,E)$ are fixed.
We have a macrostate $M$ with 3 elements, but the microstate $\mu$ will contain $6 \times 6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$ elements.

This implies that to ==one macrostate description will correspond multiple microstate descriptions.==

==But because we know that to one microstate correspond only one macrostate we have to introduce ficticious copies of the macrostates in order to make the numbers match.
This idea will lead naturally to the concept of [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Ensemble theory/Statistical ensemble]].==
