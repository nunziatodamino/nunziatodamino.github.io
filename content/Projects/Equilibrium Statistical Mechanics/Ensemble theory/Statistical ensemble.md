Let's expand on the idea that to one macrostates corresponds many microstates.

We want that the number of microstates matches the number of macrostates, so we introduces fictitious copies of the system.
To fix the ideas let's think that there are $\mathcal{N}$ macrostates copies each of which, given the first statement will be associated to a different microstate, i.e. described by a different point in the phase space.

I would like to know then, if a take a random point in the phase space and its neighborhood, how many of these $\mathcal{N}$ macrostates are represented by points in this set.
