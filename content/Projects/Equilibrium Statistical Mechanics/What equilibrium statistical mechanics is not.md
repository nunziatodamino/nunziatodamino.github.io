We can divide statistical mechanics in 2 parts:

- Equilibrium statistical mechanics also called **Statistical thermodynamics**: describes the particles behavior at equilibrium and provide the connection between mechanics and thermodynamics.
- Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics: describes the particles behavior out of equilibrium.

So is not correct to call the equilibrium part of statistical mechanics just statistical mechanics
