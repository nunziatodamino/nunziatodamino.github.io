The entropy of a system vanishes in the particular (equilibrium) state in which:

$$\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial S} \right)_{V,N_1, \dots, N_r} = 0$$
This state is where the temperature reaches is zero value. [proof]
So this implies that at the vanishing of temperature, the entropy also vanishes.


In a formal scheme of Thermodynamics, this is a postulate:
