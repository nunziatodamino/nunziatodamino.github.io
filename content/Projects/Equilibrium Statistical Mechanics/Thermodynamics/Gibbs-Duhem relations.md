Proof is simple: upon differentiation of the [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics/The Euler equation for the internal energy|Euler equation for the internal energy]] we have:

$$ dU = TdS + SdT +\sum_iP_idX_i +\sum_i X_idP_i $$

On the other hand, if we differentiate $U$ in its general form, i.e. considering that $U=U(S,X_1, \dots, X_{r+1})$, as saw in [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics/Synthetic notation|here]], we have:

$$ dU = TdS + \sum_{i}P_i\ dX_i $$

Comparing the 2 equations we obtain the Gibbs-Duhem relations:

$$ SdT + \sum_i^{r+1}P_idX_i =0 $$
