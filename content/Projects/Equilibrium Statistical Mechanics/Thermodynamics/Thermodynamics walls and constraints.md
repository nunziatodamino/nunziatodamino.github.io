A description of a thermodynamic system requires the specification of the "walls" that separate it from the surroundings and that provide its boundary conditions. **It is by means of manipulations of the walls that the**
**extensive parameters of the system are altered and processes are initiated** (i.e. simply speaking without walls we cannot establish a size criterion for the system and thus not talk about [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics/Difference between extensive and intensive variables|extensive variables]]).
We have:

- Adiabatic walls (no heat flux), if removed $\to$ Diathermic walls (heat flux exchange possible)
- Rigid walls (no mechanic work), if removed $\to$ Flexible/movable walls (mechanical work on the system possible)
- Impermeable walls (no particle flux), if removed $\to$ Permeable walls (particle flux exchange possible)

Of course a wall can be all of the above.
