All thermodynamics reduces in fact to the following problem:

**The determination of the equilibrium state that eventually results after the removal of internal constraints in a closed, composite system.**

We just now define the technical meaning of some words in the definition.

Given two or more simple systems, they may be considered as constituting a single **composite** system. 

The composite system is termed **closed** if it is surrounded by a wall that is restrictive with respect to the total energy, the total volume, and the total mole numbers of each component of the composite system. The individual simple systems within a closed composite system need not themselves be closed. 

Constraints that prevent the flow of energy, or volume, or matter among the simple systems constituting the composite system are known as **internal constraints**.
