Suppose to evaluate for a system its [[Projects/Computational methods for Material science/Molecular dynamics/Pair distribution function|Pair distribution function]].
We can have mainly 3 types of graphs:

![[Immagini/What the pair distribution function tells us about a system.png|400]]

Is clear then that $g(r)$ gives information on the phase of the system.
