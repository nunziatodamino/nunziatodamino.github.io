All the [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Course/Ensemble theory/Typical ensembles in Statistical Mechanics|ensembles]] are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit $N \to \infty$.

**So in order to use formulas that are ensemble-specific in a simulation we have 2 choices: or we use the exact ensemble prescribed, or we increase the system size.**
