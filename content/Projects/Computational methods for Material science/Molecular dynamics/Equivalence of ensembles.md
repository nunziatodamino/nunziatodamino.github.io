All the [[Projects/Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics/Typical ensembles in Statistical Mechanics|ensembles]] are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit $N \to \infty$.

**So in order to use formulas that are ensemble-specific in a simulation we have 2 choices: or we use the exact ensemble prescribed, or we increase the system size.**
