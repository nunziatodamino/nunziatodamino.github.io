In order to solve the electronic problem we have fundamentally 2 approaches:

- Guess the wavefunction form
- Guess the number density form

The latter method is the basis of **density functional theory**, and is justified by the [[Projects/Computational methods for Material science/Ab initio Quantum Mechanics/Hohenberg-Kohn theorem]]
