We want to extend the concept of [[Correlation coefficient]] to a [[Stochastic process]].

We can do this by defining the following:

>[!info] **Time correlation coefficient (or normalized time correlation function)**
>
>$$ c_{AB}(t) = \frac{\text{Cov}(A(t),B(0))}{\sigma_A\sigma_B}= \frac{\braket{(A(t)-\braket{A})(B(0)-\braket{B})}}{\sigma_A\sigma_B} $$

Sometimes one can be interested in the non-normalized form:

$$ C_{AB}(t) = \braket{(A(t)-\braket{A})(B(0)-\braket{B})} $$
