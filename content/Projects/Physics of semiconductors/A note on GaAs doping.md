![[Images/A note on GaAs doping.png]]

Suppose I want to dope GaAs and I want to be able to choose between n-doping and p-doping.
If I use Se I'm sure to have n-doping, as If I'm choosing Zn I'm sure to have p-doping.
What about Ge ?
Here I have an element of probability. If the impurity substitution happens with a Ga atom, the I have n-doping.
If it happens with As I have p-doping.
I can then think that this happens also for Si and C doping, but is false.
Chemically Si prefers a substitution with Ga, leading to n-doping (in fact in general this is how industrially n-doping of GaAs is made, not with Se), while with C I have a p-doping due to a chemically favored substitution with As.
