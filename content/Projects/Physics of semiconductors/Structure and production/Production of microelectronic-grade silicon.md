### Purification

In order to produce silicon for microelectronics, one has to purify it beyond the 99%.
We report in the following the general steps of the purification process, without much technical detail.

First step is metallurgic: one cooks the silicon oxide $\text{SiO}_2$ in a furnace with carbon coke.
This process is known technically as carbothermic reduction of $\text{SiO}_2$ and consists in the reaction:

$$\text{SiO}_2 + \text{C} \to \text{Si} + \text{CO}_2$$
This produces silicon with a 99% purity, useless for microelectronic application.

The second step in the purification consists in first dissolving the silicon in hydrochloric acid at ambient temperature (hydrochlorination of $\text{Si}$ at $300\ \text{K}$):

$$ \text{Si} + \text{HCl} \to \text{SiHCl}_3 + \text{H}_2  $$

Leading to the production of $\text{SiHCl}_3$ (trichlorosilane). This compound is then fractionated and further distilled (we reach 2 p.p.b purity for the trichlorosilane, due to its low boiling point of $31.8 \ ^{\circ}\text{C}$ ).
Finally we can recover the silicon from the trichlorosilane with an high temperature ($1150 \ ^{\circ}\text{C}$) decomposition, just below the melting point of the silicon ($1414 \ ^{\circ}\text{C}$)

In this way we finally reach a silicon sample with purity 0.2 p.p.b and typical resistivity values of the order of $500\ \text{ohm cm}$.
The only caveat is that the sample obtained is polycristalline, while we wish to obtain a single crystal.

### Recrystallization

Once a reasonably pure sample is obtained the recrystallization happens using a method known as **Czochralski growth**.
The sample is melted, then we pay attention to have at the encapsulant interface a temperature slightly inferior to the sample melting point.
A seed is then inserted at the interface and recrystallization happens following the seed.
One then can pull the formed crystal slowly, in this way a cylindrical monocrystal will form.

One can then be satisfied with the process and cut the cylinder to form wafers, or if further recrystallization wanted to be achieved one can proceed in the following way:

One can insert the cylinder in an induction ring that melts the sample. Because the solubility of defects is higher in liquids than in solids, the defects will naturally remain in the liquid zone, that will act as a natural sieve.
After many passes, one can cut the zone where the defects are concentrated and have a single crystal.
