Consider the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Rough classification of homogeneous semiconductors in function of the energy|Rough classification of homogeneous semiconductors in function of the energy]].
We can divide the 2 semiconductors islands in the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Zincblende structure|Zincblende]]/[[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Diamond structure|Diamond]] one and the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Wurzite structure|Wurzite]] one.
