The diamond structure is a single element structure of paramount importance in the description of semiconductors.
The most important difference with the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Structure and production/Zincblende structure|Zincblende structure]] is that the diamond structure contains **only 1 type of atom**.
This because the most relevant short range order in semiconductors is characterized by the $\text{sp}^3$  **tetragonal bonding**.
This imply that in all the structure we have only pure covalent $\text{sp}^3$ bonds.

We can see that a diamond structure is formed by tetragonal bonding packed as in the picture.
Note that in the picture is reported the **conventional cell**, not the unit cell

The diamond is a [[Zettelkasten/Master's degree/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Crystalline solid (or crystal)|Crystalline solid (or crystal)]], so is a Bravais lattice (FCC) equipped with the basis:

$$ \bar{b}_1=\bar{0} \qquad \bar{b}_2= \frac{a}{4} (\hat i +\hat j + \hat k) $$

We can see from the picture that the Bravais lattice unit vectors and the basis contains the atoms that form a complete tetragonal bond, so that we can see that the unit cell of the diamond crystal contains only the tetragonal bond.

This structure describes typically elemental semiconductors or elemental alloys (e.g. $\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_x$).
In the case of elemental alloy there a probability for each site equal to the stoichiometric coefficient (e.g. in $\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_x$ the Silicon can occupy each site with probability $1-x$ and the Germanium can occupy each site with probability $x$).
Each bond is a pure covalent bond.

For completeness we report also an image of the primitive cell that contains simply the tetragonal bond:
