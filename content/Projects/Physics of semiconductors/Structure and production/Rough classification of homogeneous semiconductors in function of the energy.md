![[Images/Rough classification of semiconductors in function of the energy.png|500]]

It can be useful to plot the major semiconductor compounds energy gaps versus the relative lattice constant.
In the graph we can observe roughly two main zones, one below $2 \ \text{eV}$ and one above.
We will call a semiconductor with $E_g > 2 \ \text{eV}$ a **wide gap semiconductor**.

Lines in the graph represent the properties of alloys (compound of the type $A_{1-x}B_x$ where $0<x<1$) obtained by varying the stoichiometric coefficients.
E.g. The line from $\text{Si}$ to $\text{Ge}$ follows the alloy $\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_x$, where $0<x<1$ (2 component alloy)
The line from $\text{GaAs}$ to $\text{AlAs}$ follows the alloy $\text{Ga}_{1-x}\text{Al}_x\text{As}$, where $0<x<0.5$ (3 component alloy)

Of course not all the line can be technically produced due to constraints in the production process.
