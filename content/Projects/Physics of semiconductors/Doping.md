Doping is the procedure in which we introduce impurities in the semiconductor to introduce energy levels near the band edges, where with near we intend within an energy gap if $\sim0.1 \ \text{eV}$ .

The doping breaks the translational invariance of the crystal, so that Bloch states are not perfect eigenstates.
