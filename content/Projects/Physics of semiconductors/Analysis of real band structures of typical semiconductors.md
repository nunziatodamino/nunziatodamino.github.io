As usual one plots the band structures along particular symmetry lines in the first Brillouin zone, according to the scheme above.
We focus mainly on the $\Gamma$ point part of the graph.
On the positive part of the energy electrons are represented, while in the negative part there are represented holes described in the electron language.

First is customary to describe the inverse components of the mass tensor for each band using a relative unit respect to the free electron mass.

Moreover we observe that the so called split-off band is a fine structure effect, obtained analytically only if we include in the crystal Hamiltonian the spin-orbit interaction

Here the split off band is not reported because generally the value is so small that is not reported.
Minimum is at $X$ point. Given that there are 6 $X$ points in the first Brillouin zone I have 6 equivalent minima, so one must expect a correspondent symmetry in k-space:
