We want to describe how to fill the electronic states of a general doped semiconductor, i.e. that is both n-doped and p-doped.
Clearly, using the ansatz in [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Backlog/How to fill the n-doping states|How to fill the n-doping states]] together with [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/Backlog/How to fill the p-doping states|How to fill the p-doping states]] we obtain by putting together the 2 results:

**Given that is customary to show 4 valence bands in the band structure of a semiconductor** , we have to allocate $\left[4\left(2n/\tilde{N}\right)-n_a +n_d\right]V\equiv4N-N_a+N_d$ electrons

Where we recall that $N$ is total number density of electronic states in the non-doped sample, $N_a$ is the number density of acceptors and $N_a$ is the number density of donors.
