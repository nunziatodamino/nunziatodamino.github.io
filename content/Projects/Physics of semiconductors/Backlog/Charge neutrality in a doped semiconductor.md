In a doped semiconductor an electron in the conduction band can either originate from the valence band or from the ionization of a donor (which after ionization becomes positive).
Note that these contributions, even if decoupled , considering that both contribute to total density number in the conduction band $n$ are not separated in this instance.

Likewise a hole in the valence band can correspond either to the vacancy of an electron that left the conduction band or to a negatively charged ionized acceptor.
Again we note that these contributions, even if decoupled , considering that both contribute to total density number in the valence band $p$ (in the hole picture) are not separated in this instance.
Now in total the sample must be neutral. So it must holds:

$$ n +N_a^- = p+  N_d^+ $$

Where we denoted with $N_a^-$ the number density of the ionized acceptors (that are negative) and with $N_d^+$ the number density of the ionized donors (that are positive).

Note that not all donors (or acceptors) must be ionized, and there can be a certain number in the sample that is not.
If we call for example,  the number density of neutral donors $N_d^0$ (for acceptors $N_a^0$), then we can define a total number density for donors and acceptors:

$$ N_d = N_d^0+N_d^+ \qquad N_a = N_a^0+N_a^- $$

And rewrite the charge neutrality condition as:

$$ n +N_a-N_a^0  = p +N_d-N_d^0 $$
