We first consider the natural filling for electrons in a metal, as seen in [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/General doping/How to fill the n-doping states|How to fill the n-doping states]].

We arrive to $n_{electrons}=2n_{\bar{k}-states}=2n/\tilde{N}$ per unit volume where $n$ is the atom density and $\tilde{N}$ is the number of atoms that a unit cell contains.

Now suppose we p-dope the material, introducing a certain number of acceptors per unit volume $n_a$ (final units in $\text{acceptors/cm}^3$)

**Given that is customary to show 4 valence bands in the band structure of a semiconductor** , we have to allocate $\left[4\left(2n/\tilde{N}\right)-n_a\right]V\equiv4N-N_a$ electrons

**Note that in the acceptor state we can put just one electron per state. This because, if we are putting 2 with opposite spin the binding energy reduces and the level become unstable.**

This will give birth to the band scheme in picture:

The acceptor levels will be electron free, i.e. hole filled.
