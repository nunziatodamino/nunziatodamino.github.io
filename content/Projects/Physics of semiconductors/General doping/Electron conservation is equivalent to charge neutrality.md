We can show briefly that the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/General doping/Charge neutrality in a doped semiconductor|Charge neutrality in a doped semiconductor]] condition is equivalent to the electron conservation condition in a doped semiconductor.
We simply count the electrons in 2 ways: one in the whole crystal as in [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/General doping/How to fill the states of a general doped semiconductor|How to fill the states of a general doped semiconductor]], the other we count the electrons in each band:
-  Valence band -  we have $4N - N_a -p$ : we are considering a classic complementary approach, we take the total number of electrons in the valence band ($4N-N_a$ as evaluated in the [[Projects/Physics of semiconductors/General doping/How to fill the p-doping states|How to fill the p-doping states]] ) and we take away the holes.
-  Donor states - we have $N_d^0$ : donor atoms, if partially ionized, will to the conduction band leaving just neutral donors left for the donor states.
-  Acceptor states - we have $N_a^-$ : acceptor atoms, when ionized, capture electrons. The number of electrons captured by the acceptors is $N_a^-$
-  Conduction band - we have simply $n$.

We obtain then in the end:

$$4N - N_a -p + N_d^0 + N_a^- +n = 4N-N_a+N_d$$

By simplifying:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-p + N_d^0 + N_a^-+n = +N_d \\
n+ N_a^- = +N_d^++p \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is the charge neutrality condition.
