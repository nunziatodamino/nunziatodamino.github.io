Is common in the context of microelectronics (and not only) to refer to PN junction as diodes.
### Forward biased PN junction

Suppose to have a PN junction connect to a voltage such that the positive terminal is connected to the P side, as in the picture:

Then electrons in the N side will be attracted towards the P side in order to recombine with holes (if the separation potential is exceeded) .
In this configuration a current will flow in the circuit

### Reverse biased PN junction

Suppose instead to have a PN junction connected to a voltage such that the positive terminal is connected to the N side, as in the picture:

Then electrons will be attracted towards the positive terminal, widening the depletion layer.
In this configuration NO current will flow in the circuit.
