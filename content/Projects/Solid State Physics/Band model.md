The band model arises from the shortcomings of the [[Free electron model for metals (Sommerfeld model)]]. In fact, the latter is inconsistent with experimental measurements related to the [[Hall effect]], specifically the measurement of the Hall coefficient in metals, which leads to an experimental prediction of the electron density per unit charge different from that predicted by the free electron model.
