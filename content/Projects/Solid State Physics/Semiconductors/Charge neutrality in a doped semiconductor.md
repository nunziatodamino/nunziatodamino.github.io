In a doped semiconductor an electron in the conduction band can either originate from the valence band or from the ionization of a donor (which after ionization becomes positive)
Likewise a hole in the valence band can correspond either to the vacancy of an electron that left the band or to a negatively charged ionized acceptor.

We denote with $n$ the number density of electrons that originated from the valence band and with $n_d^+$ the number density of ionized donors (which is equivalent to the one of electrons originated by ionization).
With the same ansatz we denominate for holes the number densities $p$ and $n_a^-$.

Now in total the sample must be neutral. So it must hold that the total number density of electrons is equal to the total number density of holes:

$$ n +n_a^- = p+  n_d^+ $$

Note that not all donors (acceptors) must be ionized, there will be a certain number in the sample that is not.
If we call for example, the the number density of neutral donors $n_d^0$ (for acceptors $n_a^0$), then we can define a total number density for donors and acceptors:

$$ N_d = n_d^0+n_d^+ \qquad N_a = n_a^0+n_a^- $$

And rewrite the charge neutrality condition as:

$$ n +N_a-n_a^0  = p +N_d-n_d^0 $$
