We found in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Lattice dynamics/Heat conduction by phonons with the Boltzmann equation]] the following expression for the heat conduction coefficient:

$$\kappa   =  \frac{1}{V} \sum_s\sum_{\bar{k}} \frac{\partial \braket{n}_0}{\partial T} \hbar\omega_s(\bar{k})\tau_s(\bar{k})v^2_{sx}(\bar{k})  $$

We want to show how to relate this with the [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Lattice dynamics/Phonon heat capacity in solids - Quantum treatment|specific heat expression]]:

$$ c_V = \frac{1}{V}\frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{d}{dT} \left[ \frac{1}{V} \sum_s \sum_{\bar{k}} \hbar\omega_s(\bar{k}) \left( \frac{1}{2} +\braket{n}_0 \right) \right]$$
