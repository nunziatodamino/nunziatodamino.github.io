We give here the definition of Bravais lattice

>[!info] **Bravais lattice**

The Bravais lattice (abbreviated as B.L.) is a set of vectors given by the following relation: 
$$\bar{R} = n\bar{a}_1+m\bar{a}_2+l\bar{a}_3 \qquad n,m,l \in \mathbb{Z}$$
The vectors $\bar{a}_1, \bar{a}_2, \bar{a}_3$ are called the primitive vectors of the Bravais lattice.

The box with vertices given by the primitive vectors is called the **unit cell**, whose volume is easily found through the mixed product $V_u = \bar{a}_1 \cdot (\bar{a}_2 \times \bar{a}_3)$.

Given the high symmetry of the defined structure there are only a finite number of Bravais lattices in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/List of the 3-d Bravais lattices|3D]] and [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/List of the 2-d Bravais lattices|2D]]. We observe that for the 1-d case the definition of the Bravais lattice contains only one primitive vector, the unit cell has dimensions equal to the length of the primitive vector and therefore only one type of Bravais lattice exists in 1D.

Is possible in principle to define lattices for higher dimensions, but irrelevant for our purposes.

Talking about symmetry, if we sit on a point in the Bravais lattice the structure around us is invariant by any translation of the $\bar{R}$ vector defining the B.L. , while regarding the rotational symmetry, not all rotations left the lattice invariant [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Rotational symmetry on a Bravais lattice|not all rotations left the lattice invariant]].
