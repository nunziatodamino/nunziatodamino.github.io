The idea is that when we have a structure as a [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Bravais lattice|Bravais lattice]], this has established because between the nuclei a bond is present.

Many particular bonds are presents, but a broad classification can be made:

- [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Van der Waals bond|Van der Waals bond]]
- [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Ionic bond|Ionic bond]]
- [[Covalent bond]]
- [[Metallic bond]]
- [[Hydrogen bond]]
