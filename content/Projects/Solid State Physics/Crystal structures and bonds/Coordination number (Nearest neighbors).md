One parameter of paramount importance in a [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Bravais lattice]] is the coordination number, i.e. the number of atoms that have the minimum distance from a given atom.
Due to the periodicity of the lattice, this number does not depend on the atom chosen for counting, but on the a priori structure, that is, each type of Bravais lattice has its own coordination number.

Note that in literature coordination numbers tables exists only for types of bonds:
