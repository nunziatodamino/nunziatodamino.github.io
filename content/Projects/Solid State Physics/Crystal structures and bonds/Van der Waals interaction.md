Also known as van der Waals interaction, it originates from the dipole-dipole interaction and is one of the main interactions between electrically neutral atoms or molecules, particularly when they are at a much greater distance than the average radius of their atomic orbitals.

One of its main characteristics is that:

$$\Delta U _{VdW} \propto - \frac{1}{R^6}$$
