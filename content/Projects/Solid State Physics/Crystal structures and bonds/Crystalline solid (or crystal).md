Not all the nature complexity can be described by the Bravais lattice structure.
For this reason we define:

It is said that a solid has a crystalline lattice structure if the position of each of its atoms can be described by a [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Bravais lattice|Bravais lattice]] with the addition of a basis, i.e. a set consisting of a generic number of vectors $(\bar{b}_1,\bar{b}_2, \dots, \bar{b}_r)$ . Specifically, the position $\bar{r}$ of an atom in the crystal is described by the vector: $$\bar{r} = \bar{R} + \bar{b}_1+\bar{b}_2 + \dots \bar{b}_r$$ where $\bar{R}$ is the underlying Bravais lattice.

Some [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Notable periodic crystals|notable examples]] can be seen in the attached note.
