The Brillouin Zone is the [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Wigner-Seitz Cell]] of the [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Crystal structures and bonds/Reciprocal lattice]].

Specifically we call the zone delimited by the primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice $1^{st}$ Brillouin zone.
