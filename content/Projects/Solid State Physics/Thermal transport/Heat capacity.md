The heat capacities at constant volume and constant pressure, respectively, are defined as:

$$C_V = \left(\frac{\delta Q}{\partial T} \right)_V \qquad C_P = \left(\frac{\delta Q}{\partial T} \right)_P$$

Which means, how heat varies as the temperature changes, keeping the system at constant volume or constant pressure, respectively.

Notice that $C_V$ is way easier to evaluate, because $\delta Q = dU +PdV=dU$ at constant volume, so that one can also write:

$$
C_V = \left(\frac{dU}{d T} \right)_V$$
