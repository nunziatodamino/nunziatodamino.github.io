Given a superconductor, one of the properties that exhibits is perfect diamagnetism: a magnetic field (smaller than a critical value) cannot penetrate into the bulk of a superconductor, regardless of its connectivity.

The magnetic field is expelled from the bulk of the sample when it is cooled below the critical temperature. Contrary to the superconductor, a normal conductor would keep the magnetic field in which it is embedded, when it becomes perfectly conducting, as shown in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Superconductors/Superconductivity is not just ideal conductivity|here]].

**Thus perfect conductivity does not imply perfect diamagnetism; it is the pairing mechanism, with the resulting modifications in the quasiparticle spectrum and wavefunctions, that links in a unique destiny perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism in superconducting materials.**

The absence of magnetic field in the interior of a superconductor has its origin in the “diamagnetic screening currents”, which flow in a very thin surface layer of the order of $10^{−5}$ cm thick. It is worth noticing that even if it is well known that are these self-generated lossless “supercurrents” to make $\bar{B} = 0$ in the bulk superconductor, it is generally convenient to accept the diamagnetic description of the superconductor, attributing to it an internal magnetization $\bar{M}$ (magnetic moment per unit volume). 
==ATTENZIONE: USO INTRINSECO DEL SISTEMA CGS==
We obtain easily, by using the $\bar{B}$ definition in a material and setting $\bar{B} = 0$:

$$ 0=\bar{B} = \bar{H}+4\pi\bar{M} \iff \bar{M} = -\frac{\bar{H}}{4 \pi} \iff \chi \equiv\frac{M}{H} = -\frac{1}{4 \pi}$$

We obtain from this reasoning that the static magnetic susceptibility of a superconductor is $-\frac{1}{4 \pi}$.
In a normal metal, we have $\chi \sim −10^{-6}$;  the magnetic susceptibility of a superconductor is thus about one million times larger than the susceptibility of a normal metal (even if the normal metal were ideally conducting).
**A superconducting material is thus also a superdiamagnetic material**
