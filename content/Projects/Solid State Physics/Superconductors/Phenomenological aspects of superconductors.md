Superconductivity is related to the presence of an effective attractive interaction among conduction electrons (in n-type conductors) or valence holes (in p-type conductors).

**In these notes, for brevity, we use the terminology appropriate to the case that metallic conductivity is due to electron carriers; however, the considerations below are applicable also in the specular case that metallic conductivity is due to hole carriers.**

It is generally accepted that the small attractive interaction among electrons near the Fermi energy is mediated [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Superconductors/Cooper pair formation|by the phonon field]]; in the more recent “non-conventional superconductors” other pairing mechanisms could play a role; in either cases the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory provides the appropriate general framework to interpret experimental properties. 

Above the critical temperature, the effect of the attractive interaction between electrons is in general of limited relevance (apart causing superconducting fluctuations and related phenomena). Below the critical temperature, the effect of the attractive interaction leads to the formation of highly correlated pairs of electrons (Cooper pairs) in an energy shell around the Fermi surface. As we shall see, many physical properties of this correlated electron gas are dramatically different from the corresponding properties of the normal electron gas of non-interacting electrons; **in particular the pairing mechanism entails not only perfect conductance, but also perfect diamagnetism, anomalous specific heat and transport properties, energy gap in quasiparticle spectrum, dissipationless tunneling through non-conducting layers**, and many other effects.
