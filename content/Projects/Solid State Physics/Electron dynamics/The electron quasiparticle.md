As seen in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Thomas-Fermi model for screening]], or in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Plasmons description using the Jellium model]], properties of an electron in a solid are vastly different from when is considered in vacuum.

We have then 2 choices for the study of the electron:

- To consider the electron in its fundamental instance and consider the various properties in solids as various degrees of complications deriving from the fundamental properties.
- Redefine the properties of electron in a solid so that the complications previously found are now fundamental properties, and from here build new complications.

Note that this is matter of epistemology, so fundamentally is a choice of the user.
We will discuss in this note the second approach.
In redefining the electron we cannot say that is a particle, because we already have a definition of electron as a particle.
So we will define this new electron as a quasiparticle, as it is customary.

This electron quasiparticle, for what we seen in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Thomas-Fermi model for screening]], will have a screened potential instead of a regular potential. Moreover this new potential is short-ranged, so that particles at distances greater than $\lambda_{TF}$ will not interact with the electron quasiparticle.
