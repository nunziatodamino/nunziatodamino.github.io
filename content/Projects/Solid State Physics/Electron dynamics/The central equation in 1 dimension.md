In 1 dimension there is only one Bravais lattice and its reciprocal space vectors are given by the relation : $G= \frac{2 \pi}{a}l\ \ ,l \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $a$ is the lattice constant.
So the [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/The central equation as a proof of the Bloch theorem|central equation]] reduces to:

$$\left(\frac{\left( k - \frac{2 \pi}{a}l\right)^2\hbar^2}{2m} - E\right)C_{ k - G} + \sum_{G'}C_{ k -G'}V_{G'-G}=0$$

For convenience we will call:

$$ \frac{\left( k - \frac{2 \pi}{a}l\right)^2\hbar^2}{2m} \equiv E^0_{k-G} $$

So that the central equation reads:

$$\left(E^0_{k-G} - E\right)C_{ k - G} + \sum_{G'}C_{ k -G'}V_{G'-G}=0$$
