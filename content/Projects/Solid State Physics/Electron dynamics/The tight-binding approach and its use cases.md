The tight-binding approach is a [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Band theory|Band theory]] scheme, specifically when the one-electron wavefunction is expanded in a linear combination of atomic orbitals, i.e. solutions of the isolated atom Hamiltonian.
This type of expansion is also called by its acronym LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals).

Often the quasi-free electron description of crystal is faulty. This because the core electrons of atoms forming the crystal are extremely localized, and so not respecting the quasi free description.
Moreover we must agree that these localized electrons description must not differ much by the isolated counterpart. So the idea is to describe the crystal having in mind these atomic orbitals description.
Let's take the example of sodium. Let's start by 2 isolated atoms and then we put them together at the typical lattice constant of a BCC sodium crystal.

We have that up to the $2p$ curves we have essentially no overlap, so there is no significant deviation from the isolated atom description.
For the case of the $3s$ orbitals, we have a definite orbital, so that the isolated atom description is wrong and a linear combination of the orbitals must be used.

We deduce then the following:
The tight-binding approach is required when describing core electrons which present an overlap of atomic wavefunction that requires a correction from the isolated atom description.

This case applied generally to electrons in the d-shells of noble metals, or to insulators.
