As seen in analogy with [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Lattice dynamics/Phonon momentum and crystal momentum|Phonon momentum and crystal momentum]], also for electrons one **cannot** associate to an electron the momentum $\hbar\bar{k}$.
Let's briefly see why by evaluating the mean value of the momentum for a Bloch wavefunction.
Using the calculations made in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Electron velocity and band energy|Electron velocity and band energy]], one can find immediately:

$$ \braket{\bar{p}} = \braket{\psi_{n\bar{k}}|\bar{p}|\psi_{n\bar{k}}}= \braket{u_{n\bar{k}}|\bar{p}+\hbar\bar{k}|u_{n\bar{k}}}= \hbar\bar{k} + \braket{u_{n\bar{k}}|\bar{p}|u_{n\bar{k}}} $$

Showing that $\hbar\bar{k}$ is just part of the total momentum of an electron.
In literature for this way is called electron quasi-momentum or electron crystal momentum.
