As shown in [[Projects/Solid State Physics/Electron dynamics/Electron effective mass|Electron effective mass]], we have for an electron in a solid:

$$ m^*_{ij}=\left(\frac{1}{\hbar^2}\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i\partial k_j}\right)^{-1} $$

### 1-dimension considerations

In one dimension our tensor degenerates in the following scalar:

$$ m^*=\left(\frac{1}{\hbar^2}\frac{\partial^2 E(k)}{\partial k^2}\right)^{-1} $$

This imply that for the free electron model $E = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}$ we have that the effective mass is constant and coincides with the electron rest mass $m^*=m_e$.
This result can be extended in the following way: given that in a stationary point of the band $E(k)$ can be expanded in a parabola, then its effective mass will be constant (note that effective mass can be negative).
We can conclude that near maxima and minima an electron behaves as a free electron if we give it an effective mass $m^*$ : $E(k)=  \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m^*},\ k \in B(k^*,\rho )$ where $k^*$ is the stationary value.
