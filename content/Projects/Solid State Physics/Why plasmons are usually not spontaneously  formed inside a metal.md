We saw in [[Plasmons description using the Jellium model]] that is possible to have collective electron oscillations, due to electron-electron interaction
To each oscillation there is a quasiparticle associated called plasmon with energy $\hbar \omega_P$ where $\omega_P=\sqrt{\frac{e^2n_0}{{m\varepsilon_0}}}$

We now show, by quantitative consideration, that plasmons are not usually formed inside a metal.
This because the plasmon energy is higher than the available energy in metal for electrons.
Suppose, to consider aluminium $Al$.
Its electron number density is $n \sim 1.8 \cdot 10^{29}\ \text{m}^{-3}$. If one evaluates the plasmon energy finds $\hbar \omega_P \sim 15\ \text{eV}$, while the most energetic electron has a Fermi energy of $E_F \sim 11 \ \text{eV}$.
