Suppose we want to evaluate the [[Heat capacity]] for a solid.
First we observe that is easier from a theoretical point of view to evaluate the heat capacity at constant volume.
This because $\delta Q=dU-PdV=dU$ for constant volume.
So the heat capacity at constant volume definition becomes:

$$ C_V = \left(\frac{dU}{d T} \right)_V $$

So we only need to understand how to write the internal energy for the system.
There are mainly 2 contributions, one pertaining the phonons and one pertaining the electrons, so that we can write:

$$ C_V=C_V^{\text{ph}}+C_V^{\text{el}} $$

In general if a material is an insulator there is next to none electronic contribution.

While if the material is a metal, while the electronic contribution is present, we will show in our notes that the phonon contribution is much higher than the electronic contribution at high temperatures $(T>>T_D)$, while at low temperatures is represented by :

$$ C_V = \alpha^{\text{el}}T + \alpha^{\text{ph}}T^3 $$

Giving more prominence to the electronic contribution if the temperature is lower.
