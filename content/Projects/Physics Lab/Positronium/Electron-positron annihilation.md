We know that when a positron collides with an electron, an annihilation happens, and 2 photons of energy $511\ \text{keV}$ are emitted collinearly due to momentum conservation:

$$ \beta^{-} + \beta^{+} \to \gamma+\gamma $$

This is not the only option though. Is possible to observe a decay in 3 photons, each of which with energy $\sim 340\ \text{keV}$

$$ \beta^{-} + \beta^{+} \to \gamma+\gamma+\gamma $$

But this decay is extremely more rare than the first one.
Ideally this annihilation can give birth even to $4,5,6,\dots$ photons decay, with exponentially decreasing probability.

Specifically we are interested in the comparison between the decay channels of 2 and 3 photons.
Is found experimentally, in vacuum, that the ratio between the 2 decay channels is $1/373$.
Furthermore is found that this ratio is not fixed, but dependent from the material in which the decay happens.
