The photoelectric effect describes the following phenomenon: 

>[!info] **Photoelectric effect**
When a photon of a given energy $h\nu$ (i.e. a given frequency) hits a material, if this energy is above the energy necessary to remove the electron from the material, i.e its binding energy called $W$ as in work function, then the electron will be ejected with a kinetic energy:

$$ K = h\nu -W $$
>
The emitted electron in this way is usually called photoelectron.

#### Photoelectric effect cross section

Of particular interest for the applications is the cross-section relationship with the impinging energy on the material, as shown in the below picture

In order to understand it better, let's consider a practical example : a photon impinging on a lead (Pb) atom.
We begin by reporting here the binding energy for each shell with the evaluated cross section for the photoelectric cross section in lead:

![[lead binding energies ev.png|300]]![[photoelectric cross section lead.png|300]]

As we see in the table, there is quite a gap between the K shell binding energy and the L shell. While we increase in the shell this gap tends to decrease.
Suppose we have energy way above the K shell binding energy. In this configuration I can safely suppose that almost all my electrons are ionized, so that the probability of further ionization is small.
Now suppose to have energy in the neighborhood of the K shell binding energy.
The probability of ionization rises.
If we are in the right neighborhood all electrons can be ionized, but if we are in the left neighborhood all electrons but the K ones can be ionized, so that the ionization probability is lower.
This is called K-edge and this kind of edge is present when there is a change of shell, i.e. a large gap in energy.
