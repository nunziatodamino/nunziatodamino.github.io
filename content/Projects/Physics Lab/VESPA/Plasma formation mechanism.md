## Classical method

The basic formation idea is to apply an electric field to a neutral gas.

For a neutral gas at low pressure there are free electrons available due to cosmic rays radiation or natural radioactivity. Then we apply a variable electric field in order to accelerate the electrons and produce further ionization, until an avalanche effect in ionization is produced.
We call the the potential at which the avalanche effect starts **breakdown potential**. Typical breakdown potential for this formation method are of the order $\sim 100-200\ V$
(More specifically for a gas of a pressure of $0.1\ mbar$ we expect $360\ V$ in air and $265\ V$  in Argon )
## VESPA method

Instead of relaying on the free electron induced by the cosmic rays or the natural activity, we introduce in the system more free electron by [[Thermoionic emission]].
So that, while applying the variable electric field, the avalanche process starts sooner.
Is possible in this configuration to achieve breakdown voltages of the order of $\sim 10 \ V$.
