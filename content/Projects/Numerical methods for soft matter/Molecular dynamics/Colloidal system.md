A **colloid** is a type of mixture where one substance is evenly dispersed in another, but the particles of the dispersed substance are larger than those in a solution and do not dissolve. Instead, they remain suspended throughout the dispersing medium. The particles in a colloid are typically between **1 and 1000 nanometers** in size, which is larger than the molecules or ions in a solution but small enough that they do not settle out rapidly under the influence of gravity.

Colloids can be classified based on the states of the dispersed phase and the dispersing medium. Common types include:

1. **Sol**: Solid particles dispersed in a liquid (e.g., paint, ink).
2. **Emulsion**: Liquid droplets dispersed in another liquid (e.g., milk, mayonnaise).
3. **Foam**: Gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid or solid (e.g., whipped cream, foam rubber).
4. **Aerosol**: Liquid or solid particles dispersed in a gas (e.g., fog, smoke).
5. **Gel**: A liquid dispersed in a solid (e.g., jelly, gelatin).

Colloids exhibit unique properties such as:
- **Tyndall effect**: Scattering of light by colloidal particles.
- **Brownian motion**: Random movement of particles due to collisions with molecules of the dispersing medium.
- **Stability**: Often due to repulsion between charged particles, preventing aggregation.

These characteristics distinguish colloids from true solutions and suspensions.
