### Avoiding Square Roots: Historical vs. Modern Context  

#### Historical Reasons to Avoid Square Roots  
In older computational literature, programmers were often advised to avoid computing square roots whenever possible. This advice stemmed from two main concerns:  

1. **Performance Overhead**:  
   Early computers lacked dedicated hardware for mathematical operations like square roots. Instead, iterative algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson method were used to approximate the square root of a number. These algorithms required multiple steps and consumed significant CPU cycles, making square roots much slower than basic arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication. For example, in graphics rendering or physics simulations, computing distances using the formula `sqrt(x² + y² + z²)` in a loop could drastically slow down the program.  

2. **Numerical Precision**:  
   Older systems often used limited floating-point precision, such as 32-bit floats. Square roots, especially when combined with squaring operations, could introduce rounding errors. These errors could propagate through calculations, leading to inaccurate results in scientific or engineering applications. To mitigate this, programmers often worked with squared values instead of computing actual distances. For instance, comparing squared distances (`x² + y² < r²`) avoided the need for a square root altogether.

#### Modern Improvements in Square Root Computation  
Advancements in hardware and software have largely addressed the historical concerns surrounding square roots:  

1. **Hardware Acceleration**:  
   Modern CPUs and GPUs include dedicated instructions for computing square roots efficiently. For example, x86 architectures have the `SQRTSS` instruction, and ARM architectures have `vsqrt`. These instructions can compute square roots in just a few CPU cycles, making the operation nearly as fast as basic arithmetic. GPUs also excel at parallelizing square root computations, which is particularly useful in fields like machine learning and computer graphics.  

2. **Optimized Libraries**:  
   High-performance libraries in modern programming languages leverage hardware acceleration to compute square roots quickly and accurately. For example, Python's NumPy library and C++'s Eigen library use highly optimized implementations of square root functions. These libraries ensure that square roots are no longer a bottleneck in most applications.

#### When to Still Avoid Square Roots  
Despite these improvements, there are still scenarios where avoiding square roots can be beneficial:  

1. **Performance-Critical Code**:  
   In applications where performance is critical, such as video games, physics engines, or real-time simulations, even small optimizations can make a difference. For example, replacing `sqrt(x² + y²)` with a squared comparison (`x² + y² < r²`) can save CPU cycles when checking for collisions or proximity.  

2. **Edge Cases**:  
   Squaring very large or very small numbers can lead to overflow or underflow, respectively. In such cases, it is better to use functions like `hypot(x, y)` for distance calculations, as they handle scaling and avoid intermediate squaring.  

3. **Resource-Constrained Systems**:  
   On embedded systems or microcontrollers with limited computational resources, avoiding square roots can still be advantageous. These systems often lack floating-point units (FPUs) or have limited processing power, making iterative algorithms impractical.

#### When It’s Safe to Use Square Roots  
For most modern applications, the computational cost of square roots is no longer a concern:  

1. **General-Purpose Code**:  
   In general-purpose programming, readability and maintainability are often more important than micro-optimizations. Using `sqrt(x)` directly can make code more intuitive and easier to understand.  

2. **Vectorized Operations**:  
   Libraries like NumPy or SIMD intrinsics can compute square roots across large datasets efficiently. In these cases, the overhead of `sqrt` is negligible compared to the benefits of clean, readable code.
