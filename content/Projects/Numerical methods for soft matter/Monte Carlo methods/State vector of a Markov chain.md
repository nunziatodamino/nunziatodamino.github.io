>[!info] State vector of a Markov chain
>We define state vector of a Markov chain at step $n$ the vector:
>$$\bar{\mu}_n = (\mu_n(0),\mu_n(1), \dots)=(\mathbb{P}(\xi_n=s_0),\mathbb{P}(\xi_n=s_1), \dots)$$

This vector contains the probabilities that a Markov chain is, at step $n$, at state 0 with probability $\mu_n(0)$, at state 1 with probability $\mu_n(1)$, and so on .
**In the end this vector is nothing more than an alternative representation of the probability mass function of the system at step n**
