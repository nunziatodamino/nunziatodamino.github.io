> [!info] **Aperiodic state**
> Given a Markov chain one of its state $j\in S$ is called aperiodic if:

>[!info] **Aperiodic Markov chain**
>A Markov chain is aperiodic if each one of its states is aperiodic.

> [!info] **Lemma for aperiodicity**
> If P is irreducible and exists a state that is aperiodic then all the other states are aperiodic
